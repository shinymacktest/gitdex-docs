# Backend Setup & Dependencies

The `backend` directory encapsulates all server-side logic for the MERN chat application. This section delves into the configuration and essential packages that power the backend, as defined in its `package.json` file.

## Project Structure and Scripts

The `package.json` file defines the backend's metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
The main entry point for the backend application is `src/index.js`.

```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  },
  "type": "module",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cloudinary": "^2.5.1",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.7",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "express-session": "^1.18.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.9.5",
    "passport": "^0.7.0",
    "passport-google-oauth20": "^2.0.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9"
  }
}
```

### Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the server using `nodemon`. This script is ideal for development as `nodemon` automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected.
    ```bash
    nodemon src/index.js
    ```
*   `npm start`: Runs the server using `node`. This is typically used for production environments.
    ```bash
    node src/index.js
    ```

## Key Dependencies

The backend relies on several critical packages to provide its functionality:

*   **`express`**: The fundamental web framework for Node.js, used for building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.
*   **`mongoose`**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool, enabling straightforward interaction with the MongoDB database.
*   **`bcryptjs`**: A library for hashing passwords, ensuring secure storage of user credentials.
*   **`jsonwebtoken`**: Used for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are essential for stateless authentication.
*   **`cookie-parser`**: A middleware to parse cookies attached to the client request object.
*   **`dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping sensitive configurations out of the codebase.
*   **`cloudinary`**: Integrates with Cloudinary for cloud-based image and video management, likely used for user profile pictures.
*   **`socket.io`**: Enables real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication, crucial for chat application features.
*   **`passport` & `passport-google-oauth20`**: Authentication middleware for Node.js, supporting Google OAuth for social login.
*   **`express-session`**: Middleware for managing user sessions, often used in conjunction with `passport`.

### Development Dependencies

*   **`nodemon`**: A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server.

## Backend Component Interaction

The Express backend acts as the central hub, processing requests, interacting with the database, and managing real-time communication.
