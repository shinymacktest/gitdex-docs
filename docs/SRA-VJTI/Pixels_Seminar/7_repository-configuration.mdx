## Workflow Configuration

The repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI). The `test-install-script.yml` workflow automates the testing of the `install.sh` script on various operating systems.

### Test Install Script Workflow

The `test-install-script.yml` workflow is triggered on pushes to the `main` and `test-install-script` branches, as well as on pull requests to `main`. It tests the `install.sh` script on Linux (Ubuntu, Arch Linux), Windows (WSL), and macOS.

```yaml
name: Test Install Script

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - test-install-script
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/test-install-script.yml'
      - 'install.sh'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/test-install-script.yml'
      - 'install.sh'

jobs:
  linux:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:

        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            image: ubuntu:latest
          - os: ubuntu-22.04

      - name: Make install.sh Executable
        run: chmod +x install.sh

      - name: Run Installation Script
        run: ./install.sh


  wsl:

    steps:

          wsl sudo apt install dos2unix -y
          wsl dos2unix "/mnt/d/a/Pixels_Seminar/Pixels_Seminar/install.sh"  # Convert line endings 

      - name: Make Executable and Run Script
        run: |

          wsl bash "/mnt/d/a/Pixels_Seminar/Pixels_Seminar/install.sh"  # Run the script

        run: ./install.sh
```

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/Pixels_Seminar/blob/main/.github/workflows/test-install-script.yml)

The workflow defines three jobs: `linux`, `wsl`, and `macos`. Each job runs the `install.sh` script in a different environment.

#### Linux Job

The `linux` job uses a matrix strategy to test the script on multiple Linux distributions.

```yaml
  linux:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-22.04, archlinux]
        include:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            image: ubuntu:latest
          - os: ubuntu-22.04
            image: ubuntu:22.04
          - os: archlinux
            image: archlinux:latest

    name: ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ${{ matrix.image }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Make install.sh Executable
        run: chmod +x install.sh

      - name: Run Installation Script
        run: ./install.sh
```

It checks out the repository, makes the `install.sh` script executable, and then runs it.

#### WSL Job

The `wsl` job runs the script on Windows using WSL2. It sets up WSL2, installs `dos2unix` to convert line endings, makes the script executable, and then runs it.

```yaml
  wsl:
    name: WSL
    runs-on: windows-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up WSL2
        uses: vedantmgoyal9/setup-wsl2@main

      - name: Install dos2unix and Convert Line Endings
        run: |
          wsl sudo apt update -y
          wsl sudo apt install dos2unix -y
          wsl dos2unix "/mnt/d/a/Pixels_Seminar/Pixels_Seminar/install.sh"  # Convert line endings 

      - name: Make Executable and Run Script
        run: |
          wsl chmod +x "/mnt/d/a/Pixels_Seminar/Pixels_Seminar/install.sh"
          wsl bash "/mnt/d/a/Pixels_Seminar/Pixels_Seminar/install.sh"  # Run the script
```

#### macOS Job

The `macos` job runs the script on macOS. It checks out the repository, makes the `install.sh` script executable, and then runs it.

```yaml
  macos:
    name: MacOS Latest
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Make install.sh Executable
        run: chmod +x install.sh

      - name: Run Installation Script
        run: ./install.sh
```

### Install Script

The `install.sh` script automates the installation of dependencies required for the project. It checks the operating system and installs the necessary packages using the appropriate package manager.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install required packages
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake git wget unzip

# Install libopencv-dev
sudo apt install -y libopencv-dev

# Install make
sudo apt install -y make

echo "Dependencies installation completed."
```

[View on GitHub](https://github.com/SRA-VJTI/Pixels_Seminar/blob/main/install.sh)

This script updates the package lists, installs essential build tools (like `build-essential`, `cmake`), version control (`git`), utility tools (`wget`, `unzip`), the OpenCV development library (`libopencv-dev`), and the `make` build automation tool.

### README.md Overview

The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, demonstration, and table of contents. It also includes installation instructions for setting up the project.

```markdown
# PIXELS

`PIXELS` is an introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing. Similar to a `pixel` which is the fundamental unit of any digital image, the objective is to emphasise the fundamental ideas of image and its algorithm in relation to contemporary technologies, such as the industry standard `OpenCV`. A thorough understanding of the fundamentals can aid in research and system redesign for domain-specific optimisations to meet the hardware needs of edge devices.

Every program is written in `C++` to provide the flexibility required by programmers. It also includes principles of essential development tools such as `Make` and `Git`.
