# Frontend UI & Theming

The user interface of the chat application is styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in conjunction with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), a Tailwind CSS component library. This setup allows for rapid UI development with highly customizable and themeable components.

## Tailwind CSS Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)

The `tailwind.config.js` file is the central configuration for Tailwind CSS, defining how it should process styles, handle custom extensions, and integrate plugins.

```javascript
import daisyui from "daisyui"

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily : {
        chivo : ['Chivo', 'sans-serif'],
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [daisyui],
  daisyui : {
    themes: [
        "light", "dark", "cupcake", "bumblebee", "emerald", "corporate",
        "synthwave", "retro", "cyberpunk", "valentine", "halloween",
        "garden", "forest", "aqua", "lofi", "pastel", "fantasy",
        "wireframe", "black", "luxury", "dracula", "cmyk", "autumn",
        "business", "acid", "lemonade", "night", "coffee", "winter",
        "dim", "nord", "sunset",
    ],
  }
}
```

### Key Configuration Details

-   **`content`**: Specifies the files that Tailwind CSS should scan for class names. This includes HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX files within the `src` directory, ensuring that only used styles are included in the final build.
-   **`theme.extend`**: Allows for extending Tailwind's default theme with custom values. Here, a custom font family named `chivo` is defined, which can be applied using utility classes like `font-chivo`.
-   **`plugins: [daisyui]`**: Integrates the DaisyUI plugin, which provides a collection of pre-built UI components and theme capabilities directly as Tailwind classes.
-   **`daisyui.themes`**: This crucial configuration defines the list of DaisyUI themes available for the application. The application enables a wide array of themes, allowing users to select their preferred look and feel. The currently active theme is managed by the [`useThemeStore`](2_frontend_state_management.mdx#theme-management-store-usethemestore).

### Theme System Overview

The combination of Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI provides a robust theming system.

```
1.  **Tailwind CSS**: Provides low-level utility classes and a flexible theme system for colors, spacing, typography, etc.
2.  **DaisyUI**: Builds on top of Tailwind, offering semantic component classes (e.g., `btn`, `card`, `navbar`) that automatically adapt to the chosen theme.
3.  **`data-theme`**: DaisyUI themes are applied by setting the `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` tag.
4.  **`useThemeStore`**: This Zustand store dynamically updates the `data-theme` attribute, allowing users to switch themes at runtime, with their preference persisted in `localStorage`.

This setup provides a highly flexible and aesthetically diverse user experience, making it easy to change the entire look of the application with a single theme switch.
