# Package Management

This section details the package management strategies employed for both the backend and frontend of the Job Portal application, covering dependencies and available npm/yarn scripts.

## Backend

The backend of the Job Portal utilizes npm for package management. The `package.json` file lists the project's dependencies and scripts, while `package-lock.json` ensures reproducible builds by locking dependency versions.

### Dependencies

The backend relies on several key dependencies:

*   **`express`**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
*   **`mongoose`**: A MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
*   **`bcrypt`**: For secure password hashing.
*   **`jsonwebtoken`**: For handling authentication tokens.
*   **`cors`**: To enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **`dotenv`**: To load environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **`multer`**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for file uploads.
*   **`joi`**: For data validation.
*   **`cloudinary`**: For image/file storage and management.
*   **`agora-access-token`**: For Agora real-time communication integration.
*   **`inheritance-project`**: A local dependency representing a shared component or module.
*   **`nodemon`**: A utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected.

```json
// Backend/package.json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "type": "commonjs",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "agora-access-token": "^2.0.4",
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "cloudinary": "^2.5.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",

    "mongoose": "^8.9.3",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9"
  }
}
```

### Scripts

The backend provides the following npm scripts:

*   `start`: Runs the application using Node.js.
*   `dev`: Likely intended for development, likely using `nodemon` to watch for file changes and restart the server.

```bash
# Example of running the start script
npm run start
```

```bash
# Example of running the development script (using nodemon)
npm run dev
```

## Frontend

The frontend of the Job Portal is built with React and utilizes Vite for its build tooling. npm is used for managing dependencies and scripts.

### Dependencies

Key frontend dependencies include:

*   **`react`**: The core React library for building the user interface.
*   **`react-dom`**: For rendering React components to the DOM.
*   **`react-router-dom`**: For handling client-side routing.
*   **`axios`**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
*   **`aos`**: For scroll animations.
*   **`bootstrap` & `react-bootstrap`**: For UI components and styling.
*   **`react-bootstrap-icons`**: For using Bootstrap icons within React components.
*   **`react-icons`**: A library for easily using popular icon sets.
*   **`react-hot-toast`**: For displaying toast notifications.
*   **`jwt-decode`**: For decoding JSON Web Tokens.
*   **`lucide-react`**: For SVG icons.
*   **`react-slick` & `slick-carousel`**: For implementing carousel components.
*   **`inheritance-project`**: A local dependency, likely shared with the backend.
*   **`multer`**: Included in frontend as well, potentially for client-side file handling setup or as a peer dependency.

    "postcss": "^8.4.49",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
    "vite": "^6.0.7"
  }
}
```

### Scripts

The frontend provides the following npm scripts:

*   `dev`: Starts the Vite development server.
*   `build`: Creates a production-ready build of the application.
*   `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code style and potential errors.
*   `preview`: Serves the production build locally for testing.

```bash
# To start the development server
npm run dev
```

```bash
# To build the project for production
npm run build
```

## Key Takeaways

*   **Consistent Package Management**: Both backend and frontend use npm for managing dependencies and scripts, simplifying project setup and maintenance.
*   **Version Locking**: The presence of `package-lock.json` files ensures that the exact versions of dependencies are used across different environments, preventing potential compatibility issues.
*   **Development Tools**: `nodemon` is utilized in the backend for automatic server restarts during development, and Vite's fast development server is leveraged in the frontend for an efficient development workflow.
