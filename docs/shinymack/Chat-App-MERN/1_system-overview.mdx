### Root Project Configuration

The project's root `package.json` defines scripts for managing both the frontend and backend components from a central location. This setup is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines and simplified local development workflows.

```json
{
  "name": "chatapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build" : "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start" : "npm run start --prefix backend"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```
*   **Explanation**: The `build` script first installs dependencies for both `backend` and `frontend`, then triggers the frontend build process. The `start` script initiates the backend server. This ensures that the application can be deployed or run with a single command after cloning.

```



## Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. It interacts with the backend via RESTful API calls and maintains a persistent WebSocket connection for real-time updates. Vite powers the development and build process, offering fast refresh and optimized builds.

### Key Frontend Dependencies

The `frontend/package.json` highlights the libraries and tools shaping the user experience.

```json
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "mobile": "vite --host"
  },

### Frontend Build Script with Vite

Vite is known for its speed and efficiency. The `build` script for the frontend leverages Vite to bundle the application for production.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "mobile": "vite --host"
  },
```
*   **Explanation**: The `build` command `vite build` optimizes and bundles the React application, preparing it for deployment. `dev` starts the development server, and `mobile` allows accessing the dev server from other devices on the network.
*   [View on GitHub](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/package.json#L7-L12)

## Key Integration Points

The successful operation of the Chat-App-MERN relies on several critical integration points between its components.

1.  **Client-Server API Communication**: The frontend uses `axios` to make RESTful API calls to the Express.js backend for user registration, login, fetching user profiles, and initial message loading. Authentication is managed via JWTs transmitted in HTTP headers or cookies.
2.  **Real-time Communication (Socket.IO)**: After successful authentication, the frontend establishes a persistent WebSocket connection with the Socket.IO server. This connection is vital for real-time features like instant message delivery, online status updates, and typing indicators.
    *   The `socket.io-client` in the frontend connects to the `socket.io` server in the backend, enabling a full-duplex communication channel.
3.  **Database Interaction**: The Express.js backend interacts with MongoDB via Mongoose for all data persistence needs, including user accounts, chat messages, and potentially chat room configurations.
4.  **Environment Variables (`dotenv`)**: Both frontend (during build, if needed, or via `process.env`) and backend utilize `dotenv` to manage sensitive information (e.g., database URIs, API keys, JWT secrets) and configuration settings, ensuring portability and security.
5.  **Authentication Workflow**: `jsonwebtoken`, `bcryptjs`, and `passport` on the backend work in conjunction to provide secure user authentication. The frontend stores and sends the received JWTs with subsequent requests to maintain the user's session.
6.  **Image Uploads (Cloudinary)**: When users upload profile pictures or media, the backend acts as an intermediary, handling the upload to `Cloudinary` and storing the resulting image URLs in MongoDB.

### Data Flow for a New Message

Here’s a simplified sequence illustrating how a new message travels from a sender to recipients:





```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as "Sender (Frontend)"
    participant B as "Backend (Express.js)"
    participant C as "Socket.IO Server"
    participant D as "MongoDB"
    participant E as "Recipient (Frontend)"

    A ->> C: "Emit 'sendMessage' (messageData)"
    C ->> B: "Forward 'sendMessage' to handler"
    B ->> D: "Save messageData to DB"
    D -->> B: "Confirmation"
    B ->> C: "Emit 'newMessage' (messageData) to relevant rooms/users"
    C ->> E: "Broadcast 'newMessage' (messageData)"
    E -->> A: "Update UI with new message"
```
