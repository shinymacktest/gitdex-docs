# Backend Architecture and Services

<TOC />

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the backend architecture, outlining its core components, services, and how they interact to support the chat application's functionalities. Built with Node.js and Express, the backend is designed for scalability and efficient real-time communication.

## Core Backend Technologies

The backend leverages a robust stack of technologies to deliver its services. The `package.json` file provides an excellent snapshot of these dependencies, highlighting key frameworks and libraries used.

The `dependencies` section shows the essential packages:
*   **`express`**: The primary web framework for building RESTful APIs.
*   **`mongoose`**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, simplifying database interactions.
*   **`socket.io`**: Enables real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication between clients and the server, crucial for chat features.
*   **`bcryptjs`**: For hashing passwords securely.
*   **`jsonwebtoken`**: For handling JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
*   **`passport`**, `passport-google-oauth20`, `express-session`, `cookie-parser`: A comprehensive suite for robust authentication, including session management and Google OAuth.
*   **`dotenv`**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **`cloudinary`**: For cloud-based image and video management, likely used for profile pictures or media sharing.
*   **`cors`**: Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

Below is an excerpt from `backend/package.json` detailing these dependencies:

## Application Entry Point and Configuration

The `backend/src/index.js` file serves as the main entry point for the backend application. It initializes the Express server, configures middleware, sets up routing, and connects to the database. This file is critical for bootstrapping the entire application.

Key configurations include:
*   **Middleware**: `express.json()`, `express.urlencoded()`, `cookieParser()`, `cors()`. These handle request body parsing, cookies, and cross-origin requests.
*   **Authentication**: `express-session` and `passport` are configured to manage user sessions and authentication strategies.
*   **Routes**: API routes for `auth`, `messages`, and `friends` are mounted, directing incoming requests to specific handlers.
*   **Database Connection**: The `connectDB()` function from `lib/db.js` is called to establish a connection to MongoDB.
*   **Real-time Communication**: The `socket.io` server is initialized and integrated with the Express application.
*   **Production Deployment**: Static files from the frontend build are served when in production mode, ensuring the backend can also serve the client-side application.

```javascript
// backend/src/index.js (excerpt)
import express from "express";
import cors from "cors";
import authRoutes from "./routes/auth.route.js";
import messageRoutes from "./routes/message.route.js";
import friendRoutes from "./routes/friend.route.js";
import path from "path";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";
import { connectDB } from "./lib/db.js";
import { app, server } from "./lib/socket.js";
import session from "express-session";
import passport from "passport";
import { configurePassport } from "./lib/passport.config.js";

const __dirname = path.resolve();
dotenv.config();

configurePassport();

app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.json({limit : '2mb'}));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ limit: '2mb', extended: true }));
app.use(cors({
    origin: "http://localhost:5173", // Frontend URL
    credentials: true,
}));

app.use(session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET, 
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false, 
    cookie: {
        secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production", 
        httpOnly: true,
        maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 
    }
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());  

app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes );
app.use("/api/messages", messageRoutes );
app.use("/api/friends", friendRoutes);

// ... (production static file serving)

server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log("server is running on PORT: " + String(PORT));
    connectDB();
});
```

## Database Connection Management

The `backend/src/lib/db.js` file is responsible for establishing and managing the connection to the MongoDB database. It uses Mongoose to create a robust and persistent connection, logging connection status and any potential errors.

```javascript
// backend/src/lib/db.js
import mongoose from "mongoose"

export const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);
    console.log(`MongoDB connected:  ${conn.connection.host}`);
  }
  catch(error){
    console.log("MongoDB connection error: ", error);
  }
}
```

This modular approach ensures that database logic is encapsulated, making the application easier to maintain and test.

## Real-time Communication with Socket.IO

Real-time features like instant messaging and online user presence are handled by `socket.io`, initialized in `backend/src/lib/socket.js`. This module sets up the Socket.IO server, manages client connections, and broadcasts events.

Key functionalities:
*   **Server Initialization**: An `http` server is created using `express` and then wrapped by `socket.io`.
*   **CORS Configuration**: Socket.IO also requires its own CORS configuration to allow connections from the frontend.
*   **User Tracking**: A `userSocketMap` object stores `userId` to `socketId` mappings, enabling targeted messaging and tracking of online users.
*   **Connection/Disconnection Handling**: Events `connection` and `disconnect` are handled to update the `userSocketMap` and notify all clients about online user changes.
*   **Online Users Broadcast**: `io.emit("getOnlineUsers", Object.keys(userSocketMap))` regularly informs all connected clients about who is currently online.

```javascript
// backend/src/lib/socket.js (excerpt)
import { Server } from "socket.io";
import http from "http";
import express from "express";

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);

const io = new Server(server, {
    cors: {
        origin: ["http://localhost:5173"] // Frontend URL
    }
})

export function getReceiverSocketId(userId) {
    return userSocketMap[userId];
}

const userSocketMap = {}; //{userId : socketId}

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    console.log("A user connected", socket.id);

    const userId = socket.handshake.query.userId;
    if(userId) userSocketMap[userId] = socket.id;

    io.emit("getOnlineUsers", Object.keys(userSocketMap));

    socket.on("disconnect", ()=>{
        console.log("A user disconnected", socket.id);
        delete userSocketMap[userId]; 
        io.emit("getOnlineUsers", Object.keys(userSocketMap));
    })
})

export { io, app, server };
```

## Key Integration Points

The backend serves as the central hub for all application logic and data management. Its integration points are critical for a seamless user experience:

*   **Frontend-Backend Communication**: The client interacts primarily via RESTful API calls for initial data fetching and operations, complemented by WebSocket (Socket.IO) for real-time updates. CORS is meticulously configured to ensure secure communication between the frontend (on `localhost:5173` or production domain) and the backend.
*   **Authentication & Authorization**: Passport.js is deeply integrated to handle various authentication strategies, including local (username/password) and OAuth (Google). Sessions are managed via `express-session`, ensuring users remain authenticated across requests. Middleware in routes protects sensitive endpoints, ensuring only authenticated and authorized users can access specific resources.
*   **Database Interactions**: Mongoose provides an abstraction layer over MongoDB, allowing developers to work with structured schemas and powerful querying capabilities. The `connectDB` function ensures a reliable connection, vital for data persistence.
*   **Real-time Synchronization**: Socket.IO is a cornerstone for the chat functionality. It manages connections, tracks online users, and facilitates instant message delivery. The `userSocketMap` is a simple yet effective mechanism for routing messages to specific online users, making the chat experience immediate and dynamic.
*   **Environment Configuration**: `dotenv` is used to manage sensitive information (database URIs, session secrets, API keys) outside of the codebase, ensuring security and flexibility across different deployment environments (development, production).
*   **Cloud Storage**: Integration with services like Cloudinary (indicated by the dependency) allows for efficient storage and delivery of media assets, offloading heavy file management from the main server.

By meticulously handling these integration points, the backend ensures a robust, secure, and highly responsive foundation for the chat application.
