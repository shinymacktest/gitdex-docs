## Getting Started

Here's a basic example of using `aeon` for time series classification:

```python
import numpy as np
from aeon.classification.distance_based import KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier

X = np.array([[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]],
             [[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2]],
             [[8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 4]]])
y = np.array(['low', 'low', 'high'])

clf = KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier(distance="dtw")
clf.fit(X, y)

X_test = np.array(
    [[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]], [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]], [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]]
)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
print(y_pred)
```

This snippet demonstrates fitting a `KNeighborsTimeSeriesClassifier` to sample time series data and making predictions.  [View on GitHub](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/blob/main/README.md)

## Clustering Example

```python
import numpy as np
from aeon.clustering import TimeSeriesKMeans

X = np.array([[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]],
             [[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2]],
             [[8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 4]]])

clu = TimeSeriesKMeans(distance="dtw", n_clusters=2)
clu.fit(X)

print(clu.labels_)

X_test = np.array(
    [[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]], [[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]], [[6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]]]
)
print(clu.predict(X_test))
```

## Example Transformation

```python
from aeon.transformations.series.exponent import ExponentTransformer
import pandas as pd

# Sample time series data
data = pd.Series([1, 4, 9, 16, 25])

# Initialize the ExponentTransformer with an exponent of 0.5 (square root)
transformer = ExponentTransformer(power=0.5)

# Fit and transform the data
transformed_data = transformer.fit_transform(data)

print(transformed_data)
```

This example shows how to use the `ExponentTransformer` to apply a power transformation to a time series. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon/blob/main/aeon/transformations/series/exponent.py)
