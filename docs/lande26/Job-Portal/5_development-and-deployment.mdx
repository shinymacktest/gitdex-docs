# Development and Deployment

This section outlines the tools, configurations, and settings necessary for the development and deployment of the Job Portal.

## Backend Development and Setup

The backend is built with Node.js and Express, leveraging several key dependencies for functionality.

### Project Structure and Scripts

The `package.json` file in the `Backend` directory defines the project's scripts and dependencies.

```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "type": "commonjs",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "agora-access-token": "^2.0.4",
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "cloudinary": "^2.5.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "inheritance-project": "file:..",
    "joi": "^17.13.3",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.9.3",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9"
  }
}
```

Key scripts include:
- `npm start`: To run the server.
- `npm run dev`: (Assumed, common practice with nodemon) For development with hot-reloading.

### Key Backend Dependencies

*   **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
*   **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
*   **Bcrypt**: For password hashing.
*   **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
*   **Multer**: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for file uploads.
*   **Cloudinary**: A cloud-based solution for image and video management.
*   **CORS**: Node.js middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **Dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

## Frontend Development and Setup

The frontend is built using React with Vite as the build tool.

### Project Structure and Scripts

The `package.json` file in the `Frontend` directory contains the scripts for managing the frontend application.

```json
{
  "name": "inheritance",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "aos": "^2.3.4",
    "axios": "^1.7.9",
    "bootstrap": "^5.3.3",
    "inheritance-project": "file:..",
    "jwt-decode": "^4.0.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.469.0",
    "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-bootstrap": "^2.10.7",
    "react-bootstrap-icons": "^1.11.5",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-hot-toast": "^2.5.1",
    "react-icons": "^5.4.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.1.3",
    "react-slick": "^0.30.3",
    "slick-carousel": "^1.8.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@eslint/js": "^9.17.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.3.18",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.5",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.3.4",
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20",
    "eslint": "^9.17.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.37.2",
    "eslint-plugin-react-hooks": "^5.0.0",
    "eslint-plugin-react-refresh": "^0.4.16",
    "globals": "^15.14.0",
    "postcss": "^8.4.49",
    "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
    "vite": "^6.0.7"
  }
}
```

Key scripts include:
- `npm run dev`: To start the development server with hot-reloading.
- `npm run build`: To create a production-ready build of the frontend.

### Vite Configuration

The `vite.config.js` file configures Vite for the project.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';


export default defineConfig({
  base: '/',
  plugins: [react()],
});
```

This configuration sets the base path to `/` and enables the React plugin.

## Deployment Configuration

For deployment, particularly to platforms like Vercel, routing is handled via the `vercel.json` file.

```json
{
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
    ]
  }
```

This configuration ensures that all incoming requests are rewritten to `/index.html`, which is crucial for single-page applications (SPAs) that rely on client-side routing.

## Development Workflow

A typical development workflow would involve:

1.  **Backend**:
    *   Start the backend server using `npm start` (or `npm run dev` if configured with nodemon).
    *   Develop API endpoints and logic.
2.  **Frontend**:
    *   Start the frontend development server using `npm run dev`.
    *   Develop UI components and integrate with backend APIs using `axios`.
3.  **Testing**:
    *   Run backend tests with `npm test`.
    *   Run frontend linting with `npm run lint`.
4.  **Building for Production**:
    *   Build the frontend with `npm run build`.
    *   Deploy the built frontend and the running backend service.

## Key Takeaways

The Job Portal utilizes a standard MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Vite for efficient frontend development and build processes. Deployment configurations are designed to support SPA routing. Consistent use of npm scripts ensures a streamlined development and build cycle.
