## System Purpose

This document provides an overview of the Chat-App-MERN application.  This application is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to create accounts, login (including Google OAuth), send and receive messages in real-time, and provides a user-friendly interface.  The application leverages Socket.IO for real-time communication and utilizes several libraries for security, database interaction, and user authentication.

### Key Features

*   **Real-time Chat:** Users can communicate with each other in real-time using websockets.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication is implemented using both local accounts and Google OAuth.
*   **User Accounts:**  Users can create and manage their profiles.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and work across various devices.


## Technology Stack

The application utilizes a classic MERN stack architecture.  The following table summarizes the key technologies used:

| Technology       | Frontend                               | Backend                                 | Database         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Framework        | React                                    | Express.js                              | MongoDB            |
| State Management | Zustand                                  |                                          |                    |
| Routing          | React Router DOM                         |                                          |                    |
| UI Library       | DaisyUI, Lucide-React, React Icons      |                                          |                    |
| Real-time       | Socket.IO-Client                         | Socket.IO                               |                    |
| API Calls        | Axios                                    |                                          |                    |
| Authentication  |                                          | Passport, Passport-Google-OAuth20, jsonwebtoken, bcryptjs |                    |
| Server Runtime  | Node.js (via Vite)                      | Node.js                                 |                    |
| Package Manager | npm (Yarn for Frontend; NPM for Backend) | npm                                     |                    |


### Frontend Dependencies ([frontend/package.json](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/package.json))

The frontend utilizes various React libraries and tools for building the user interface and handling real-time communication.  Key dependencies include:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.9",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "lucide-react": "^0.471.1",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-hot-toast": "^2.5.1",
    "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.1.1",
    "socket.io-client": "^4.8.1",
    "zustand": "^5.0.3"
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Backend Dependencies ([backend/package.json](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/backend/package.json))

The backend relies on Express.js for routing and handling API requests, Mongoose for database interaction, and various authentication and security libraries.  Noteworthy dependencies include:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cloudinary": "^2.5.1",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.7",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "express-session": "^1.18.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.9.5",
    "passport": "^0.7.0",
    "passport-google-oauth20": "^2.0.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Application Architecture





```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend (React)] -->|HTTP Requests| B(Backend (Express.js));
    B -->|Socket.IO| C(Socket.IO Server);
    A -->|Socket.IO| C;
    B -->|Database Interactions| D((MongoDB));
    subgraph "Authentication"
        B --> E[Passport.js];
        E --> F[Google OAuth];
        E --> G[Local Auth (bcrypt)];
    end
```



The architecture diagram above illustrates the key components and interactions within the Chat-App-MERN application. The frontend interacts with the backend via HTTP requests for initial data and account management. Real-time communication is facilitated through the Socket.IO server, allowing for immediate message updates.  The backend handles authentication, database interactions, and message routing.

## Build and Deployment

The `package.json` at the root level defines scripts for building and starting the application:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start": "npm run start --prefix backend"
  }
}
```

This demonstrates a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend build processes.  The `build` script installs dependencies for both and builds the frontend, while `start` runs the backend.


## Key Integration Points and Insights

The successful integration of Socket.IO for real-time communication is a critical aspect of this application. Proper handling of authentication (using both local and Google OAuth strategies) ensures user security.  The use of environment variables (`dotenv`) facilitates a smoother deployment process.
