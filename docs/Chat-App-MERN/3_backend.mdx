# Backend and Data

<TOC />

The backend utilizes Express.js, a Node.js framework, to handle API requests.  Data is persistently stored in a MongoDB database.

## API Endpoints (Inferred)

Based on the frontend code, the backend likely provides endpoints for:

*   **Authentication:** `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/google` (Google OAuth).
*   **User Data:** Endpoints to fetch user data (friends list, profile information).
*   **Chat Messages:** Endpoints for sending and receiving chat messages in real-time (likely using WebSockets, though not explicitly shown in provided code).


## Database Schema (Inferred)

The MongoDB database likely contains collections for:

*   **Users:**  `_id`, `username`, `email`, `password`, `profilePic`, and potentially other user details.
*   **Messages:** `_id`, `senderId`, `recipientId`, `text`, `timestamp`, and potentially other message metadata.
*   **Friendships:** A collection representing the relationships between users (likely a many-to-many relationship).



## Axios Configuration

The frontend uses Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API:

```javascript
// frontend/src/lib/axios.js
import axios from "axios";

export const axiosInstance = axios.create({
    baseURL: import.meta.env.MODE == "development" ? "http://localhost:5001/api": "/api",
    withCredentials: true,
});
```

The `withCredentials: true` option ensures that cookies are included in requests, facilitating session management.
