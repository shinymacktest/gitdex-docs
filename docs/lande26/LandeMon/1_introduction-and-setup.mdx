## Local Development

To set up Landemon for local development, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm or yarn**: A package manager. npm is included with Node.js; yarn can be installed globally (`npm install -g yarn`).
*   **TMDb API key**: You'll need an API Read Access Token (v4 auth) from The Movie Database. [Register for an account](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) and obtain your key from your [API settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    Start by cloning the Landemon project from its GitHub repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lande26/movieko.git
    cd movieko
    ```
    [View `movieko` repository on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko)

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Navigate into the cloned directory and install all required project dependencies using either npm or yarn.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
    This command reads the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` listed in your `package.json` and installs them.

3.  **Configure environment variables**:
    Landemon relies on environment variables for sensitive data and configuration. Create a `.env` file by copying the provided example.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    [View `.env.example` on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko/blob/main/.env.example)

    Now, open the newly created `.env` file and populate it with your specific values:
    ```plaintext
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_TOKEN=your_tmdb_api_key_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Landemon
    ```
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Set this to `http://localhost:3000` for local development.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_TOKEN`: Replace `your_tmdb_api_key_here` with your actual TMDb API Read Access Token.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME`: The desired name for your application.

4.  **Start the development server**:
    Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured, you can start the development server.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This command initiates the Next.js development server, which includes hot-reloading for a smooth development workflow.

5.  **Open your browser**:
    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to see Landemon running locally.

### Build for Production

To build the application for a production environment and run it:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
The `npm run build` script compiles the Next.js application into optimized production assets, and `npm run start` serves the built application.

## Environment Variables

Understanding the required environment variables is crucial for both local development and deployment.

| Variable                 | Description                                    | Required | Example                      |
| :----------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`    | The full URL where your application is deployed | Yes      | `https://landemon.vercel.app` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_TOKEN` | Your TMDb API key for movie data access        | Yes      | `eyJhbGci...`                |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME`  | The display name for your site                 | Yes      | `Landemon`                   |

### Getting a TMDb API Key

1.  **Create Account**: Sign up for a free account at [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup).
2.  **Access Settings**: Go to your account `Settings` and then select `API`.
3.  **Request API Key**: Choose the "Developer" option and request a new API key.
4.  **Copy Token**: Locate and copy your **API Read Access Token (v4 auth)**. This is the value you will use for `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_TOKEN`.

> **Note**: The `.env.example` file contains a default token for testing purposes. For any production deployment or serious development, it is **imperative** to use your own unique TMDb API key.

## Key Integration Points and Configuration Insights

Understanding the project's configuration files provides deeper insight into its structure and how various parts integrate.

### `package.json` Overview

**Key Scripts:**
*   `dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
*   `build`: Creates an optimized production build of the Next.js application.
*   `pages:build`: Specifically for Cloudflare Pages deployment, utilizing the `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` package.
*   `start`: Serves the production-built application.
*   `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
*   `format`: Formats code using Prettier, ensuring consistent code style.
*   `typecheck`: Performs a TypeScript type check without emitting any JavaScript.
*   `prepare`: Installs Husky Git hooks, facilitating pre-commit and pre-push checks for linting and formatting.

**Dependencies:**
Notable dependencies include `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` for robust environment variable validation, `@tanstack/react-query` for server state management, `@trpc/*` for end-to-end type-safe APIs, and `@vercel/analytics` and `@vercel/speed-insights` for performance monitoring. The inclusion of `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` as both a dependency and devDependency highlights its role in enabling Cloudflare Pages deployments.

### `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript Configuration

The `tsconfig.json` file is fundamental for configuring the TypeScript compiler.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "incremental": true,
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "next"
      }
    ],
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": [
    // ... included files
  ],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```
[View `tsconfig.json` on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko/blob/main/tsconfig.json)

**Key Configuration Points:**
*   `"strict": true`: Enables all strict type-checking options, promoting robust code.
*   `"noEmit": true`: Ensures TypeScript only performs type checking and doesn't output JavaScript files, letting Next.js handle the compilation.
*   `"jsx": "preserve"`: Instructs TypeScript to leave JSX syntax as-is for Next.js to process.
*   `"paths": { "@/*": ["./src/*"] }`: Configures path aliases, allowing imports like `import Component from "@/components/Component"` instead of relative paths, simplifying module resolution. This is a common pattern in Next.js projects for better maintainability.
*   `"plugins": [{ "name": "next" }]`: Integrates the Next.js TypeScript plugin, providing enhanced type checking and autocompletion specific to Next.js features.

### `tailwind.config.ts` for UI Styling

The `tailwind.config.ts` file is where Tailwind CSS is configured, defining the design system for Landemon.

```typescript
import { fontFamily } from "tailwindcss/defaultTheme";
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    screens: {
      xs: "500px",
      // ... other screen sizes
    },
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: "4vw",
      screens: {
        "2xl": "1400px",
      },
    },
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // ... custom color palette using HSL variables
      },
      borderRadius: {
        // ... custom border radii using CSS variables
      },
      keyframes: {
        "accordion-down": {
          from: { height: 0 },
          to: { height: "var(--radix-accordion-content-height)" },
        },
        // ... other keyframes
      },
      animation: {
        // ... custom animations
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ["var(--font-sans)", ...fontFamily.sans],
        heading: ["var(--font-heading)", ...fontFamily.sans],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate")],
};
```
[View `tailwind.config.ts` on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko/blob/main/tailwind.config.ts)

**Key Configuration Points:**
*   `darkMode: ["class"]`: Enables dark mode based on the presence of a `dark` class in the HTML, allowing for theme toggling.
*   `content`: Specifies all files where Tailwind should look for classes to generate its CSS, ensuring optimized bundle sizes.
*   `theme.screens`: Defines custom breakpoints for responsive design beyond the default Tailwind sizes, like `xs` at `500px`.
*   `theme.container`: Configures a default container class for consistent content width and padding.
*   `theme.extend`: This section is crucial for customizing and extending Tailwind's default theme.
    *   `colors`: Defines a custom color palette, using CSS HSL variables (e.g., `var(--primary)`) for dynamic theming (e.g., light/dark mode).
    *   `borderRadius`: Customizes border-radius values, also referencing CSS variables for consistency.
    *   `keyframes` and `animation`: Defines custom CSS animations, particularly for Radix UI components like accordions.
    *   `fontFamily`: Integrates custom fonts (`--font-sans`, `--font-heading`), ensuring a distinct typographic style.
*   `plugins`: Includes `tailwindcss-animate`, which provides utilities for animating with CSS variables and keyframes.

These configuration files collectively define the Landemon project's technical foundation, from its development environment and build process to its styling and type safety.
