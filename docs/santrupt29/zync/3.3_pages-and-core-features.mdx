 # Pages and Core Features

This section provides a detailed overview of the core pages within the Zync application's frontend, outlining their purpose, key components, and integration points. Each page is designed to deliver a specific user experience, from initial authentication to real-time communication.

## AuthPage: User Authentication

The `AuthPage.jsx` component serves as the primary gateway for users to sign in or sign up to the Zync application. It provides a welcoming interface with branding, key features, and a clear call to action for authentication via Clerk.

*   **Purpose**: Facilitate user authentication (sign-in/sign-up) using Clerk.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   **Brand Presentation**: Displays the Zync logo and name.
    *   **Hero Section**: Highlights the application's value proposition ("Where Work Happens ✨") and core features (real-time messaging, video calls, secure & private).
    *   **`SignInButton`**: Leverages Clerk's pre-built UI component for authentication, configured in `modal` mode.
    *   **Visual Elements**: Includes illustrative images and an overlay for an engaging aesthetic.

**Authentication Flow**

The authentication process is straightforward, relying entirely on Clerk's robust service. When a user clicks the "Get Started with Zync" button, Clerk's authentication modal is triggered, handling the entire sign-in or sign-up flow.

```jsx
// frontend/src/pages/AuthPage.jsx
// Line 39-44
<SignInButton mode="modal">
  <button className="cta-button">
    Get Started with Zync
    <span className="button-arrow">→</span>
  </button>
</SignInButton>
```

The `AuthPage` focuses purely on presentation and initiating the Clerk authentication flow, delegating the actual user management and session handling to Clerk.

## HomePage: Real-time Messaging and Channel Management

The `HomePage.jsx` is the central hub for real-time messaging, displaying active channels, direct messages, and enabling users to create new communication channels. It heavily relies on the Stream Chat SDK for its core functionality.

*   **Purpose**: Provide the main chat interface, including channel lists, message displays, and user management.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   **`Chat` Context**: The root component from `stream-chat-react` that provides the chat client context to all child components.
    *   **`ChannelList`**: Displays a list of channels the user is a member of, allowing for filtering and custom previews.
    *   **`CustomChannelPreview`**: A custom component to render each channel in the list, enabling specific styling and behavior.
    *   **`CreateChannelModal`**: A modal component (likely for creating new public or private chat channels).
    *   **`UsersList`**: Displays a list of other users for direct messaging.
    *   **`Channel`**: Renders the active chat channel, containing message history and input.
    *   **`CustomChannelHeader`**: Provides a custom header for the active channel, showing channel name, members, and possibly call initiation options.
    *   **`MessageList` / `MessageInput` / `Thread`**: Standard Stream Chat components for displaying messages, composing new ones, and managing message threads.
    *   **`UserButton`**: Clerk's component for user profile management.

**Chat Initialization**

The `HomePage` initializes the Stream Chat client using a custom `useStreamChat` hook, which manages the client's lifecycle and loading state. The active channel is determined by URL search parameters, allowing for deep linking into specific conversations.

```jsx
// frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx
// Line 25-33
  useEffect(() => {
    if (chatClient) {
      const channelId = searchParams.get("channel");
      if (channelId) {
        const channel = chatClient.channel("messaging", channelId);
        setActiveChannel(channel);
      }
    }
  }, [chatClient, searchParams]);
```
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/santrupt29/zync/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx#L25-L33)

This ensures that upon loading the page, if a `channel` parameter is present in the URL, the corresponding channel is automatically made active.

**Channel Interaction Flow**

The user's interaction with channels and direct messages follows a clear path:





```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User lands on HomePage"] --> B{"Is 'channel' param in URL?"};
    B -- "Yes" --> C["Activate Channel based on param"];
    B -- "No" --> D["Default view (e.g., first channel or welcome)"];
    C --> E["Display active Channel: CustomChannelHeader, MessageList, MessageInput"];
    D --> E;
    E --> F["User interacts with ChannelList"];
    F --> G["Click CustomChannelPreview"];
    G --> H["Update URL searchParams with new channel ID"];
    H --> C;
    E --> I["User opens CreateChannelModal"];
    I --> J["Create new Channel"];
    J --> F;
```



This flow illustrates how users navigate between channels, either directly via URL or by selecting from the `ChannelList`.

## CallPage: Real-time Video Conferencing

The `CallPage.jsx` component is dedicated to handling real-time video and audio calls using the Stream Video SDK. It orchestrates the connection to a specific call instance, manages user participation, and provides call controls.

*   **Purpose**: Enable users to join and participate in video and audio calls.
*   **Key Components**:
    *   **`StreamVideo`**: The root component for the Stream Video SDK, providing the video client context.
    *   **`StreamCall`**: Manages a specific call instance, handling connection and state.
    *   **`CallControls`**: Provides UI elements for call management (mute, unmute, end call, etc.).
    *   **`SpeakerLayout`**: Displays participants in a speaker-focused layout.
    *   **`useCallStateHooks`**: A hook from the SDK to access the current state of the call, such as `CallingState`.
    *   **`getStreamToken`**: An API utility function to fetch an authentication token for Stream services.

**Call Initialization and Connection**

Upon entering the `CallPage` with a `callId` from the URL, the component fetches a Stream token for the current user. Once the token is acquired, a `StreamVideoClient` and `StreamCall` instance are initialized, and the user attempts to join the call.

```jsx
// frontend/src/pages/CallPage.jsx
// Line 30-49
    const initCall = async () => {
      if (!tokenData.token || !user || !callId) return;

      try {
        const videoClient = new StreamVideoClient({
          apiKey: STREAM_API_KEY,
          user: {
            id: user.id,
            name: user.fullName,
            image: user.imageUrl,
          },
          token: tokenData.token,
        });

        const callInstance = videoClient.call("default", callId);
        await callInstance.join({ create: true });

        setClient(videoClient);
        setCall(callInstance);
      } catch (error) {
        console.log("Error init call:", error);
        toast.error("Cannot connect to the call.");
      } finally {
        setIsConnecting(false);
      }
    };
```

If the user successfully joins, `StreamVideo` and `StreamCall` components render, displaying the video conference interface with `SpeakerLayout` and `CallControls`. If the call state indicates the user has `LEFT`, they are programmatically navigated back to the home page.

## LandingPage: Marketing and Overview

The `LandingPage.jsx` serves as the public-facing entry point for the Zync application. It's designed to attract new users by showcasing the application's features, benefits, and social proof.

*   **Purpose**: Introduce Zync, highlight its features, provide social proof, and encourage user sign-up.
*   **Key Sections**:
    *   **Hero Section**: Captivates visitors with a catchy title, descriptive subtitle, key feature pills, and a "Get Started" call to action. It uses subtle animations and floating UI elements for visual appeal.
    *   **Stats Section**: Displays impressive statistics about Zync's usage and reliability.
    *   **Features Section**: Details Zync's core functionalities with icons, titles, and descriptions.
    *   **Testimonials Section**: Showcases positive feedback from current users to build trust.
    *   **Footer**: Provides navigation links and legal information.
*   **Navigation**: The "Get Started with Zync" button navigates users to the `/auth` page to initiate the sign-up/sign-in process.

**Call to Action**

The primary call to action on the landing page is to initiate the authentication flow, directing users to the `AuthPage`.

```jsx
// frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx
// Line 110-112
  const handleLogin = async () => {
    navigate("/auth");
  }
```
[View on GitHub](https://github.com/santrupt29/zync/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx#L110-L112)

This simple handler ensures a smooth transition from marketing content to the user onboarding process.

## Key Integration Points

### User Identity and Authentication (Clerk)

Clerk is a cornerstone for user identity in Zync. Both the `AuthPage` and `HomePage` (`UserButton`) directly integrate with Clerk. The `CallPage` also relies on the authenticated `user` object from Clerk to fetch Stream tokens.





```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User"] --> B["AuthPage"];
    B -->|"Sign In/Up"| C["Clerk Frontend SDK"];
    C --> D["Clerk Backend"];
    D -->|"Authentication Status"| B;
    B -->|"Authenticated"| E["HomePage"];
    E -->|"Access User Info"| F["UserButton (Clerk)"];
    E --> G["CallPage"];
    G -->|"Use User ID to get Stream Token"| H["Backend API"];
    H -->|"Stream Token"| G;
```



This diagram highlights how Clerk manages user identity across different pages, either directly through its UI components or by providing user data for backend interactions.

### Real-time Communication (Stream SDKs)

Stream's Chat and Video SDKs are fundamental to Zync's core functionality.

*   **Stream Chat Integration (`HomePage`)**: The `HomePage` uses `Chat`, `ChannelList`, `Channel`, `MessageList`, `MessageInput`, and `Thread` components from `stream-chat-react`. A custom `useStreamChat` hook handles client initialization.
*   **Stream Video Integration (`CallPage`)**: The `CallPage` uses `StreamVideo`, `StreamCall`, `CallControls`, and `SpeakerLayout` from `@stream-io/video-react-sdk` for video conferencing. It fetches a token from the backend to authorize the Stream Video client.

This layered integration allows for robust and scalable real-time communication capabilities within the application.
