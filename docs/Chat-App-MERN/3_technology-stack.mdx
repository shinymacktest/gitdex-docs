## System Purpose

This application provides a real-time chat functionality. Core functionalities include:

*   **User Registration and Authentication:**  Users can register new accounts and log in securely. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/unknown/unknown/blob/main/backend/src/index.js)
*   **Real-time Messaging:** Users can send and receive messages instantly with other connected users. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/unknown/unknown/blob/main/backend/src/index.js) and [View on GitHub](https://github.com/unknown/unknown/blob/main/frontend/src/App.jsx)
*   **(Potentially) Media Sharing:**  The architecture allows for future expansion to include media sharing capabilities.


## System Architecture Overview

The application follows a three-tier architecture:

*   **Presentation Tier (Frontend):**  Handles user interface and interaction using React, Zustand for state management, and Lucide React for icons.
*   **Business Tier (Backend):**  Manages user authentication, message routing, and database interactions using Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.IO for real-time communication.  This tier also uses  Mongoose for database interaction and Passport for authentication strategies.
*   **Data Tier (Database):** Stores user data and chat messages using MongoDB.

## Core Application Features

*   **Secure Authentication:** Uses Passport.js with a Google OAuth2.0 strategy for secure user authentication and authorization.  The backend handles JWT generation and verification for subsequent requests. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/unknown/unknown/blob/main/backend/src/index.js)
*   **Real-time Chat:** Leverages Socket.IO for bidirectional, real-time communication between the client and server. This allows for immediate message delivery and updates without constant polling.  [View on GitHub](https://github.com/unknown/unknown/blob/main/backend/src/index.js)


```javascript
// Example of Socket.IO Server-Side setup (Backend)
// ... other imports ...
const io = require('socket.io')(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('a user connected');
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('user disconnected');
  });
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    io.emit('chat message', msg); // Broadcast to all connected clients
  });
});
// ...rest of the code...

```

```javascript
// Example of Socket.IO Client-Side message handling (Frontend)
import io from 'socket.io-client';
const socket = io();

socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
  // Update UI with the received message
});

const sendMessage = (message) => {
  socket.emit('chat message', message); // Send a message to the server
};

## Key Integration Points

*   **State Management (Frontend):** Zustand is used for efficient and predictable state management within the React application, making it easier to manage the chat messages and user interactions.
*   **API Calls (Frontend to Backend):** Axios handles HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend for tasks such as user authentication and potentially fetching data.
*   **Authentication Flow:**  The frontend uses JWTs received during the OAuth2.0 flow to authorize subsequent requests to the backend. The backend validates JWTs to ensure secure access.
*   **Database Interaction (Backend):** Mongoose provides an abstraction layer over MongoDB, making it easier to interact with the database and manage data persistence.


Best Practices:

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The clear separation between the frontend and backend promotes maintainability, scalability, and allows for independent development and deployment.
*   **Scalability:**  The use of Socket.IO for real-time communication allows for handling a large number of concurrent users efficiently.  The database choice (MongoDB) is also well-suited for handling large volumes of data.
*   **Security:** JWT-based authentication and bcryptjs for password hashing enhance security.
