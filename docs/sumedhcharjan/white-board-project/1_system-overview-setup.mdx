# System Overview & Setup

The Collaborative Whiteboard project is a real-time, interactive MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application designed to facilitate seamless collaboration through a shared digital canvas. It allows multiple users to draw, erase, and share images in a synchronized environment, making it ideal for brainstorming, teaching, or collaborative design sessions.

## Project Purpose and Scope

The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust and intuitive platform for real-time visual collaboration. Its scope encompasses fundamental whiteboard functionalities like drawing and erasing, enhanced with modern features such as secure user authentication, image sharing, and persistent board storage. The application aims to deliver a responsive and engaging user experience across various devices.

## Key Features

The Collaborative Whiteboard offers a rich set of features to enhance the collaborative experience:

*   **Real-time Drawing:** Collaborative drawing with multiple users, enabling instant synchronization of strokes and shapes across all connected clients.
*   **Image Upload:** Users can upload and share images directly onto the whiteboard, powered by Cloudinary for efficient storage and delivery.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions and protect board access.
*   **Multi-user Support:** Designed from the ground up to support multiple participants drawing and interacting simultaneously on the same board.
*   **Drawing Tools:** A comprehensive suite of drawing tools including various pens, an eraser, shapes, customizable colors, and brush sizes.
*   **Save Boards:** Functionality to save and retrieve whiteboard sessions, allowing users to revisit and continue their collaborative work.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent and fluid user experience.

## General Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture, leveraging WebSockets for real-time communication.

```



The frontend, built with React, handles user interface rendering and drawing logic. It communicates with the Express.js backend via standard HTTP requests for authentication and board management, and through Socket.io for real-time drawing synchronization and other live events. The backend interacts with MongoDB for data persistence and Cloudinary for image asset management.

## Technology Stack

The project is built using the MERN stack with additional tools for real-time capabilities and enhanced functionality.

### Frontend Technologies

*   **React:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Socket.io Client:** Enables real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication between the browser and server.
*   **HTML5 Canvas API:** Provides the core drawing functionality within the browser.
*   **CSS3 & Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling and creating a responsive design.
*   **React Context API:** Manages global state across components.
*   **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
*   **React Router DOM:** For declarative routing in the single-page application.
*   **@auth0/auth0-react:** Potentially used for authentication integration, as indicated by `frontend/package.json`.

### Backend Technologies

*   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side logic.
*   **Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
*   **Socket.io:** Facilitates real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers.
*   **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database used for storing user data, whiteboard sessions, and drawing states.
*   **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
*   **Cloudinary:** A cloud-based service for image and video management, used for uploading and serving images.
*   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for secure user authentication and authorization.
*   **bcrypt:** A library for hashing passwords securely.
*   **CORS:** Middleware to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
*   **dotenv:** Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **nodemon:** A tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories: `backend` and `frontend`, representing the server-side and client-side components of the application, respectively.

*   `whiteboard-project/`
    *   `backend/`: Contains the Node.js/Express.js server, API routes, database models, and Socket.io implementation.
    *   `frontend/`: Contains the React application, UI components, drawing canvas logic, and client-side Socket.io integration.
    *   `.env.example`: A template for environment variables.
    *   `README.md`: Overall project documentation.

## Setup Guide

To run the Collaborative Whiteboard project locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Node.js:** (v14 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **MongoDB:** (local instance or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas) - [Download MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository - [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Cloning the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kalpm1110/whiteboard-project.git
cd whiteboard-project
```

### Configuration of Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Populate it with the necessary environment variables, replacing placeholder values with your actual credentials.

```plaintext
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/whiteboard
# or use MongoDB Atlas: mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/whiteboard

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Server Configuration
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Installation and Starting the Application

Install the dependencies for both the backend and frontend, then start the development servers.

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Navigate into the frontend directory and install its dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..

# Start both backend and frontend concurrently
npm run dev
```

Alternatively, you can start the backend and frontend services separately in different terminal windows:

```bash
# To start the backend only
npm run server
```

```bash
# To start the frontend only (in a separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
```

Upon successful startup, the application will be accessible at:

*   **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
*   **Backend API:** `http://localhost:5000`
