# Database Schema

This section details the data models used within the Job Portal application, outlining the structure and types of data stored for users, companies, jobs, and job invites.

## User Model

The `UserModel` is designed to store information for regular users of the platform. It includes essential details for authentication and user identification.

```javascript
const UserSchema = new Schema({
    username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    createdAt: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now
    }
});
```

The `EModel` (Employer Model) serves a similar purpose for company representatives or employers, sharing the same fundamental fields for identification and authentication.

```javascript
const ESchema = new Schema({
    username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    createdAt: {
        type: Date,
        default: Date.now
    }
});
```

## Company Profile Model

The `CompanyProfile` model stores detailed information about registered companies. This includes company identification, descriptive information, and contact details.

```javascript
const companySchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        username: { type: String, required: true, default: "" },
        companyName: { type: String, default: "" },
        industry: { type: String, default: "" },
        description: { type: String, default: "" },
        website: { type: String, default: "" },
        email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, default: "" },
        phone: { type: String, default: "" },
        location: { type: String, default: "" },
        foundedYear: { type: Number, default: "" },
        revenue: { type: String, default: "" },
        linkedin: { type: String, default: "" },
        services: { type: String, default: "" },
        technologies: { type: String, default: "" },
        companypicurl: { type: String, default: "" }
    }
);
```

## Jobs Model

The `JobsModel` defines the structure for job postings. Each job entry contains details about the role, company, location, salary, and application requirements.

```javascript
const jobSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    jobprofile: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "Job profile is required"],
        trim: true
    },
    companyusername: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "Company username is required"],
        trim: true
    },
    location: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "Location is required"],
        trim: true
    },
    salary: {
        type: Number,
        required: [true, "Salary is required"]
    },
    type: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "Job type is required"]
    },
    description: {
        type: String,
        required: [true, "Job description is required"]
    },
    requirements: {
        type: String,
        default: "No specific requirements provided"
    },
    deadline: {
        type: Date,
        required: [true, "Application deadline is required"]
    },
    openings: {
        type: Number,
        default: 1
    },
    experience: {
        type: String,
    },
    appliedCandidatesID: {
        type: Array,
        default: []
    }
},
    {
        timestamps: true
    });
```

## Invite Model

The `InviteSchema` is used to manage interview invitations sent to candidates. It stores the recipient's username, the date and time of the invitation, a meeting link, and the associated job ID.

```javascript
const InviteSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    username: String,
    date: String,
    time: String,
    link: String,
    jobId: String
});
```

## Key Takeaways

The database schema is designed to be relational, with distinct models for users, employers, company profiles, job postings, and interview invitations. This separation ensures data integrity and allows for efficient querying and management of application-specific information. Each model includes appropriate field validations and defaults to maintain data consistency.
