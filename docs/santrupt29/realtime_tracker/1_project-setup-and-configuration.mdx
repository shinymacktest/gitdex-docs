# Project Setup and Configuration

This section outlines the initial setup and configuration for the `realtime_tracker` project, detailing its structure, dependencies, and how to get started.

## Project Structure and Dependencies

The `realtime_tracker` project is a Node.js application built using Express for the web server and Socket.IO for real-time communication. The core dependencies are defined in the `package.json` file.

The primary dependencies are:

*   **`express`**: A robust Node.js web application framework that simplifies the creation of APIs and web servers.
*   **`socket.io`**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers.
*   **`ejs`**: An embedded JavaScript templating engine, used here for rendering HTML views dynamically.

The `package-lock.json` file precisely defines the versions of all installed dependencies, ensuring reproducible builds.

```json
{
  "name": "realtime_tracker",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "ejs": "^3.1.10",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
  }
}
```

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/santrupt29/realtime_tracker.git
    cd realtime_tracker
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary packages, including their sub-dependencies, ensuring all versions are consistent as per `package-lock.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

After the installation is complete, the project is ready to be run.

## Running the Application

The primary script for running the application is defined in `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
}
```

To start the server, you would typically use:

```bash
node app.js
```

This command executes the `app.js` file, which is designated as the main entry point of the application.

## Key Takeaways

The `realtime_tracker` project relies on a standard Node.js setup with Express for serving content and handling HTTP requests, and Socket.IO for managing real-time WebSocket connections. The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files are crucial for managing and ensuring the consistency of project dependencies.
