# Backend Overview

<TOC />

This section provides a high-level overview of the backend for the chat application, which is built using Express.js and interacts with a MongoDB database.  Detailed specifications for the backend routes and database schema are not included in this document but would be a logical extension.

## Functionality

The backend handles several key functionalities:

*   **User Authentication:** Manages user login, registration, and session management.
*   **Message Management:**  Handles the sending, receiving, and storage of messages in the database.
*   **Friend Management:**  Facilitates the management of friend requests, friend lists, and relationships between users.

Further documentation is needed to outline the specific API endpoints and database structure.  This would involve detailing request/response structures using tools like Swagger or Postman.

This diagram illustrates a simplified flow of a request from the frontend, through the API, and its interaction with the database.
