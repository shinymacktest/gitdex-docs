# Deployment and Configuration

<TOC />

This document outlines the deployment and configuration procedures for the MERN Chat application.  The application consists of a frontend (React) and a backend (Node.js with Express) communicating via Socket.IO for real-time functionality.

## Frontend Deployment and Configuration

The frontend, located in the `frontend` directory, uses Vite for development and build processes.  Its dependencies are managed via `package.json`.

### Frontend Dependencies

The `frontend/package.json` file details the project's dependencies and devDependencies. Key packages include:

*   **React & React-DOM:** Core React libraries for building the user interface.
*   **React Router DOM:** For handling client-side routing within the application.
*   **Socket.IO-Client:**  Connects the frontend to the backend's Socket.IO server for real-time communication.
*   **Axios:**  Used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
*   **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
*   **Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI:** For styling the application.
*   **Lucide React:** For providing icons in the UI.
*   **React Hot Toast:** For displaying notifications and messages to the user.

  },
  // ... devDependencies omitted for brevity ...
}
```

### Frontend Build and Deployment

To build the application for production, run `npm run build` in the `frontend` directory. This will generate optimized files in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment to a web server (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3).


## Backend Deployment and Configuration

The backend, residing in the `backend` directory, is a Node.js application using Express.js.  `package.json` defines the project structure and dependencies.

### Backend Dependencies

The backend leverages several key packages:

*   **Express:** The web application framework.
*   **Mongoose:**  For interacting with MongoDB.
*   **Passport:** An authentication middleware.
*   **Passport-Google-OAuth20:**  For Google OAuth 2.0 authentication.
*   **Bcryptjs:** For password hashing.
*   **jsonwebtoken:** For generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
*   **Cookie-parser:** For parsing cookies.
*   **Dotenv:** For loading environment variables.
*   **Socket.IO:** For real-time communication.
*   **Cloudinary:** For image and media uploads.


```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {

    "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9"
  }
}
```

### Backend Deployment

To start the backend application, navigate to the `backend` directory and run `npm run dev` for development mode (with Nodemon for automatic restarts) or `npm start` for production.  You'll need to set up your environment variables (database connection string, Google OAuth credentials, etc.)  using the `.env` file.


## Application Architecture

````mermaid

    A[Frontend (React)] --> B(Socket.IO);
    B --> C[Backend (Node.js)];
    C --> D((MongoDB));
    C --> E(Cloudinary);
    A -.-> F[Google OAuth];
    F --> C;
```

This diagram illustrates the application's architecture. The frontend communicates with the backend primarily through Socket.IO for real-time messaging.  The backend interacts with a MongoDB database for persistent data storage and Cloudinary for handling media uploads.  Authentication is facilitated by Google OAuth 2.0.


##  Environment Variables

Both frontend and backend might require environment variables.  The backend especially needs them for database connection and API keys.  It's crucial to set up a `.env` file in the backend directory to store sensitive information securely.  Remember **never** to commit `.env` files to version control.


```
# Example .env file for the backend
DATABASE_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_client_secret"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"
```



## File Structure

````mermaid
graph TD
    A[README.md] --> B(backend);
    B --> C(src);
    B --> D(package.json);
    A --> E(frontend);
    E --> F(src);
    E --> G(package.json);
    C --> H[index.js];
    F --> I[main.jsx];


```

This diagram illustrates the basic file structure of the application.  The `src` folder in both `frontend` and `backend` contains the core application logic.



The configuration and deployment process involves building the frontend, setting up the backend environment, and configuring the database and authentication services.  Remember to consult the specific documentation for your chosen hosting platform for detailed deployment instructions.
