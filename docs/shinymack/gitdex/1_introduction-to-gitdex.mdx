## Getting Started

### Client-Side (Next.js)

To get started with the client-side application, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

3.  Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

```javascript
// client/app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to GitDex</h1>
      <p>Start exploring your codebase!</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Server-Side (Bun)

To get started with the server-side component, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  Create a `.env` file and configure the necessary environment variables, such as the OpenAI API key and Redis connection details.

4.  Run the server:

    ```bash
    bun run index.ts
    ```

```javascript
// server/index.ts
import express from 'express';
const app = express();
const port = 3001;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GitDex Server is running!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

## Core Dependencies

The client-side leverages several key dependencies, including `@fumadocs/mdx-remote`, `@octokit/rest`, and various UI libraries like `@shadcn/ui` and `lucide-react`. These are essential for rendering MDX documentation, interacting with GitHub's API, and providing a visually appealing interface.

On the server, `@google/genai`, `@octokit/rest`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `express`, `ioredis`, and `mermaid` are crucial for interacting with OpenAI's Gemini API, the GitHub API, enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, loading environment variables, creating the server, connecting to Redis, and rendering Mermaid diagrams server-side, respectively.

```json
// server/package.json (dependencies section)
"dependencies": {
    "@dqbd/tiktoken": "^1.0.22",
    "@google/genai": "^1.17.0",
    "@octokit/rest": "^22.0.0",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^17.2.3",
    "express": "^5.1.0",
    "ioredis": "^5.8.1",
    "mermaid": "^11.12.0"
  }
```

## Data Flow





```mermaid
graph LR
    A["Client (Next.js)"] --> B{"API Request (Express)"};
    B --> C["Redis Cache"];
    C -- "Cache Hit" --> D["Response to Client"];
    B --> E{"OpenAI Models"};
    E --> F["Generated Documentation"];
    F --> C;
    C -- "Cache Miss" --> F;
    F --> D;
    D --> A;
```



## Key Integration Points

1.  **GitHub API Integration:** GitDex uses the Octokit library to interact with the GitHub API. This allows it to fetch repository metadata, access file contents, and retrieve commit history.

    ```typescript
    // Example of fetching repository information using Octokit
    import { Octokit } from "@octokit/rest";

    const octokit = new Octokit({
      auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN,
    });

    async function getRepoInfo(owner: string, repo: string) {
      const { data } = await octokit.rest.repos.get({
        owner,
        repo,
      });
      return data;
    }
    ```

2.  **OpenAI Model Integration:** GitDex leverages OpenAI's language models to analyze code and generate documentation. The specific models and prompts used will depend on the desired level of detail and the complexity of the codebase.

3.  **Redis Integration:** Redis is used to cache the results of code analysis and documentation generation. This significantly improves performance by reducing the number of requests to the OpenAI models.

```javascript
// server/index.ts (Redis setup - conceptual)
import Redis from 'ioredis';

const redis = new Redis({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
  port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT || '6379'),
});

// Example of caching data in Redis
async function getCachedData(key: string) {
  const data = await redis.get(key);
  return data ? JSON.parse(data) : null;
}

async function setCachedData(key: string, data: any, expiry: number = 3600) {
  await redis.set(key, JSON.stringify(data), 'EX', expiry);
}
```

## Best Practices

*   **API Key Management:** Store your OpenAI API key securely using environment variables and avoid committing it to your codebase.
*   **Caching Strategy:** Implement a robust caching strategy to minimize the load on the OpenAI models and ensure fast response times.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages to the user.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of the API rate limits imposed by OpenAI and GitHub. Implement rate limiting in your code to avoid exceeding these limits.
*   **Modular Design:** Design your code in a modular and reusable way to facilitate future development and maintenance.
