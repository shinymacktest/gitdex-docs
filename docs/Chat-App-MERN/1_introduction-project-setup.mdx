# Introduction and Project Setup

<TOC />

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to the Chat-App-MERN project, detailing its purpose, the core technologies employed, and the steps required to get the application up and running locally. This MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application serves as a real-time chat platform, demonstrating modern web development practices.

The project is built upon foundational concepts often found in full-stack applications, integrating a robust backend with a dynamic frontend to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Project Overview

The Chat-App-MERN project is designed to be a fully functional real-time chat application. Users can register, log in, send messages to each other, and see message updates in real-time. It leverages `socket.io` for bidirectional communication, ensuring instant message delivery and a responsive user interface.

**Key Features:**

*   **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and `bcryptjs` for password hashing.
*   **Real-time Messaging**: Instant message sending and receiving powered by WebSockets via `socket.io`.
*   **MongoDB Database**: Persistent storage for user data and chat messages.
*   **Scalable Architecture**: A clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.
*   **Responsive UI**: A modern, interactive user interface built with React.js.

### Root `package.json`

The root `package.json` simplifies the build and start processes by orchestrating commands for both the frontend and backend.

```json
{
  "name": "chatapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build" : "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start" : "npm run start --prefix backend"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```
*   The `build` script automates the installation of dependencies for both `backend` and `frontend` and then triggers the frontend build process.

## Initial Setup

To get the Chat-App-MERN project running on your local machine, follow these steps. This process assumes you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN.git
cd Chat-App-MERN
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Use the root `build` script to install all necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend. This single command streamlines the setup process:

```bash
npm run build
# This command effectively runs:
# npm install --prefix backend
# npm install --prefix frontend
# npm run build --prefix frontend
```
This will install `node_modules` in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.

### 3. Environment Variables (Backend)

The backend requires environment variables, particularly for database connection and JWT secrets. Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory.

Example `backend/.env` file:

```dotenv
MONGO_DB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.abcde.mongodb.net/chatapp?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"
```
*   **`MONGO_DB_URI`**: Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `cluster0.abcde` with your MongoDB Atlas connection string or your local MongoDB URI.
*   **`JWT_SECRET`**: A strong, random string for signing JSON Web Tokens.
*   **Cloudinary Credentials**: If you plan to use image uploads (e.g., for user profile pictures), provide your Cloudinary credentials. These can be omitted if not using image uploads.

### 4. Start the Backend Server

Navigate to the root of the project and run the `start` script, which will initiate the backend server:

```bash
npm start
# This command effectively runs:
# npm run start --prefix backend
# which then executes: node src/index.js inside the backend folder
```
The backend server should start on `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

### 5. Start the Frontend Development Server

Open a **new terminal window** (keep the backend server running in the first terminal), navigate to the root of the project, and then into the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend development server will start, usually on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port). Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.

### Setup Flow Diagram

```



## Key Integration Points

*   **Authentication Flow**: The frontend sends user credentials to `/api/auth/login` or `/api/auth/signup`. The backend validates these, creates a JWT, and sends it back as an `httpOnly` cookie. Subsequent requests from the frontend automatically include this cookie for authentication.
*   **Real-time Communication**: After successful authentication, the frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the backend using `socket.io-client`. The backend's `socket.io` server listens for events (e.g., `sendMessage`), processes them (e.g., saves to MongoDB), and broadcasts updates (e.g., `newMessage`) to relevant clients.
*   **API Interactions**: The `axios` library in the frontend is used to make RESTful API calls to the Express.js backend for operations like fetching messages, user profiles, or initiating chat sessions.
*   **State Management**: `Zustand` on the frontend manages global application state, such as the currently logged-in user, active chat, and incoming messages, ensuring a reactive UI.
