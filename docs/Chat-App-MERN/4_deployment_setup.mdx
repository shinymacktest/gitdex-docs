# Deployment and Setup

<TOC />

This document outlines the deployment and setup instructions for the MERN Chatapp application.  The application consists of a frontend built with React and a backend built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: a frontend (`frontend/`) and a backend (`backend/`).

    C --> G[src/];
    D --> H[src/];

```

## Backend Setup

The backend, located in the `backend/` directory, uses Node.js and Express to handle API requests and manages user authentication, data storage (via MongoDB), and real-time communication (using Socket.IO).

### Dependencies

The `backend/package.json` file lists all the necessary dependencies for the backend:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cloudinary": "^2.5.1",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.7",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "express-session": "^1.18.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.9.5",
    "passport": "^0.7.0",
    "passport-google-oauth20": "^2.0.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
  }
}
```

*   **`express`**: The core Node.js web framework.
*   **`mongoose`**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
*   **`bcryptjs`**: For password hashing.
*   **`jsonwebtoken`**: For creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) used for authentication.
*   **`passport`**: An authentication middleware for Express.
*   **`passport-google-oauth20`**: Enables Google OAuth 2.0 authentication.
*   **`socket.io`**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
*   **`dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.  This is crucial for securely managing sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
*   **`cookie-parser`**: Parses cookies from requests.
*   **`cloudinary`**: Likely used for image/file storage and management.

### Running the Backend

The backend can be started using the following commands:

*   **Development:** `npm run dev` (uses `nodemon` for automatic restarts on code changes) [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/backend/package.json)
*   **Production:** `npm start` [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/backend/package.json)


## Frontend Setup

The frontend, located in the `frontend/` directory, is built using React, Vite, and several other libraries.

### Dependencies

The frontend's dependencies are defined in `frontend/package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.7.9",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "lucide-react": "^0.471.1",
    "react": "^18.3.1",
    "react-dom": "^18.3.1",
    "react-hot-toast": "^2.5.1",
    "react-icons": "^5.5.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^7.1.1",
    "socket.io-client": "^4.8.1",
    "zustand": "^5.0.3"
  }
}
```

*   **`react`**, **`react-dom`**: Core React libraries.
*   **`react-router-dom`**: For client-side routing.
*   **`axios`**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
*   **`socket.io-client`**: The client-side library for Socket.IO, allowing real-time communication with the backend.
*   **`zustand`**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
*   **`lucide-react`**:  Likely an icon library.
*   **`react-hot-toast`**: A library for displaying notifications.
*   **`react-icons`**: Another icon library.
*   **`cors`**: Although listed as a dependency, `cors` is a middleware for Express.js and wouldn't be directly used in the React frontend.  Its inclusion here is likely a mistake.


### Running the Frontend

The frontend uses Vite for development and build processes:

*   **Development:** `npm run dev` [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/package.json)
*   **Build:** `npm run build` [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/package.json)
*   **Preview:** `npm run preview` [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/package.json)
*   **Mobile Preview:** `npm run mobile`  [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/package.json)

## Communication Flow

The frontend and backend communicate using a combination of HTTP requests (for data fetching and authentication) and Socket.IO (for real-time chat messages).

```


## Deployment Considerations

For deployment, you would typically need to:

*   Set up a MongoDB database instance.
*   Deploy the backend to a server (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud).
*   Build the frontend and deploy it to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
*   Configure environment variables appropriately for both frontend and backend.
