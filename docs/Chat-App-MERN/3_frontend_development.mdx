# Frontend Development

<TOC />

This section provides an overview of the client-side application's fundamental structure, how it initializes, its core dependencies, and the basic organization of its UI components.

## Entry Point: `frontend/index.html`

The `frontend/index.html` file serves as the single entry point for the entire client-side application. It's a standard HTML document that includes a root `div` where the React application will be mounted and a script tag that loads the main JavaScript entry file.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml+png" href="/icon.png" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Chatty</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Key elements:
*   `<div id="root"></div>`: This is the DOM element where the React application will be injected and rendered.
*   `<script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>`: This line imports the `main.jsx` file, which is responsible for initializing the React application and rendering the primary component into the `#root` div.

## Initial Application Load Flow

The client-side application starts by loading `index.html`, which in turn executes `/src/main.jsx`. `main.jsx` then uses React DOM to render the root `App.jsx` component into the `<div id="root">` element. This `App.jsx` component acts as the main container, typically setting up routing and global layouts for the application. Global styles defined in `frontend/src/index.css` are also applied early in this process.

## Core Frontend Dependencies

The `frontend/package.json` (managed by `package-lock.json`) outlines all the essential libraries and tools used for building the client-side application. These dependencies define the core technologies and frameworks utilized.

The primary dependencies include:

*   **`react`**, **`react-dom`**: The fundamental libraries for building user interfaces with React.
*   **`react-router-dom`**: Enables declarative routing within the single-page application.
*   **`axios`**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to the backend.
*   **`socket.io-client`**: The client-side library for real-time, bidirectional event-based communication with the server.
*   **`zustand`**: A small, fast, and scalable state-management solution for React.
*   **`daisyui`**, **`tailwindcss`**: A component library built on top of Tailwind CSS, providing a set of pre-designed UI components and a utility-first CSS framework for styling.
*   **`lucide-react`**, **`react-icons`**: Libraries providing a collection of customizable SVG icons.

Here's a snippet from `frontend/package-lock.json` showing the main dependencies and development tools:

## UI Components and Pages

The frontend application organizes its user interface into reusable components and distinct pages:

*   **`frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`**: An example of a reusable component, such as a navigation bar, which can be integrated across multiple pages or layouts.
*   **`frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx`**: Represents a specific view or screen of the application, typically combining several smaller components to form a complete page.
