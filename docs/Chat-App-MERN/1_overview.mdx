# MERN Chat Application Overview

<TOC />

## Architecture

This project is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) chat application.  It consists of a frontend built with React and a backend built with Node.js, Express.js, and utilizing Socket.IO for real-time communication.  Data persistence is handled by MongoDB.

The frontend handles user interface elements, while the backend manages authentication, data processing, and real-time communication via Socket.IO. MongoDB stores user data, messages, and friend relationships.
