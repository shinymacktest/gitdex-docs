# Backend Development

<TOC />

This section provides a detailed overview of the backend architecture, focusing on the server-side components, their core functionalities, and the key dependencies that power them. Understanding these elements is crucial for grasping how the application processes requests, manages data, handles authentication, and supports real-time communication.

The `package-lock.json` file outlines all the direct and transitive dependencies for the backend, giving us insight into the technologies used.

### Core Dependencies

The primary dependencies for the backend, as indicated by `backend/package.json` within `package-lock.json`, include:

*   **`express`**: The foundational web framework for Node.js, responsible for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware management.
*   **`socket.io`**: Enables real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication between the server and clients, essential for chat functionalities.
*   **`mongoose`**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool, simplifying interactions with the MongoDB database.
*   **`bcryptjs`**: A library to help you hash passwords, ensuring user password security.
*   **`jsonwebtoken`**: Implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication and authorization.
*   **`cookie-parser`**: Middleware to parse cookies attached to the client request object.
*   **`dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping sensitive configurations out of the codebase.
*   **`cloudinary`**: Cloud-based image and video management service, used for storing and serving user-uploaded media (e.g., profile pictures).
*   **`passport`**: Authentication middleware for Node.js, providing a flexible framework for various authentication strategies.
*   **`passport-google-oauth20`**: A specific Passport strategy for authenticating users via Google OAuth 2.0.
*   **`express-session`**: Middleware to manage user sessions, often used in conjunction with Passport.js.

### Development Dependencies

*   **`nodemon`**: A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server, greatly enhancing the development workflow.

### Backend Component Interaction

The following diagram illustrates how these key backend components interact to provide the application's functionalities:

This architecture ensures a robust, scalable, and secure backend capable of handling user requests, data persistence, authentication, and real-time communication.
