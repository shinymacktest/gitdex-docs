# Data Models & Database
<TOC />

This section delves into the foundational data structures and database connectivity for the application. It outlines how the application interacts with MongoDB, powered by Mongoose, to manage user and message data effectively. Understanding these models and the database connection mechanism is crucial for comprehending the application's backend architecture and data persistence strategy.

The design emphasizes data integrity, scalability, and maintainability, leveraging Mongoose's schema validation, referencing capabilities, and lifecycle hooks.

## Database Connection Management

The application establishes a robust connection to its MongoDB database through a dedicated utility file. This approach centralizes the connection logic, making it easier to manage, monitor, and troubleshoot database interactions.

### The `connectDB` Function

The `connectDB` function is responsible for initiating the connection to MongoDB. It utilizes the `mongoose` library, a popular ODM (Object Data Modeling) tool for Node.js and MongoDB.

#### **WHAT it Does**

The `connectDB` function asynchronously connects the Node.js application to a MongoDB instance. It retrieves the MongoDB connection string from environment variables (`process.env.MONGODB_URI`), promoting secure and flexible deployment across different environments (development, staging, production). Upon successful connection, it logs the host to the console; otherwise, it logs the error, providing critical feedback during application startup.

#### **WHY it's Designed This Way**

*   **Centralization:** All database connection logic resides in one place, simplifying maintenance and upgrades.
*   **Environment Variable Use:** Using `process.env.MONGODB_URI` ensures that sensitive connection details are not hardcoded into the source, enhancing security and allowing seamless configuration changes without code modification.
*   **Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block gracefully handles connection errors, preventing application crashes and providing immediate diagnostic information.
*   **Asynchronous Operation:** Database connections are I/O-bound operations and are inherently asynchronous. Using `async/await` provides a clean, readable way to manage these operations without blocking the main thread.

#### **HOW it Works**

The function calls `mongoose.connect()` with the URI. If the connection is successful, `mongoose.connect()` returns a promise that resolves with the connection object. The hostname is then extracted from this object and logged. In case of failure, the `catch` block intercepts the error and logs it.

```javascript
// backend/src/lib/db.js
import mongoose from "mongoose"

export const connectDB = async () => {
  try {
    const conn = await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);
    console.log(`MongoDB connected:  ${conn.connection.host}`);
  }
  catch(error){
    console.log("MongoDB connection error: ", error);
  }
}
```

## Mongoose Data Models

Mongoose schemas define the structure of documents within MongoDB collections, enforce validation, and establish relationships between different data entities. The application utilizes two primary models: `User` and `Message`.

### User Model

The `User` model (`User.js`) is central to the application, representing individual users and their associated data, including authentication details, social connections, and profile information.

#### **WHAT it Defines**

The `User` schema defines the structure for user documents in the `users` collection. It includes fields for user identification (`email`, `username`), authentication (`password`, `authProvider`, `googleId`), profile customization (`profilePic`), and social networking features (`friends`, `friendRequests`, `sentRequests`). Each field comes with specific validation rules to ensure data quality and integrity.

#### **WHY it's Designed This Way**

*   **Comprehensive User Profile:** Captures essential information for user management and interaction.
*   **Unique Identifiers:** `email`, `username`, and `googleId` are marked `unique` to prevent duplicate user accounts, ensuring data integrity. `googleId` also uses `sparse: true` to allow multiple users without a `googleId` while maintaining uniqueness for those who have one.
*   **Data Validation:** `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, and `trim` properties enforce strict validation rules directly at the schema level, reducing the need for redundant validation logic in application code.
*   **Flexible Authentication:** The `authProvider` field, along with `password` and `googleId`, supports multiple authentication strategies (e.g., email/password, Google OAuth), making the system adaptable to different user preferences.
*   **Social Graph:** `friends`, `friendRequests`, and `sentRequests` fields are arrays of `ObjectId` references to other `User` documents. This design efficiently models many-to-many relationships for social connections, allowing for easy querying and population of related user data.
*   **Timestamps:** `timestamps: true` automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to each document, which are invaluable for auditing, tracking changes, and sorting data chronologically.
*   **`pre('save')` Hook for Authentication Logic:**
    *   **WHAT it Does:** This middleware runs before a `User` document is saved. It dynamically modifies the `password` field based on the `authProvider`. If `authProvider` is 'google' and the password hasn't been modified, it sets `password` to `undefined`. If `authProvider` is 'email' and a new user is being created without a password, it throws an error.
    *   **WHY it's Designed This Way:** This hook is crucial for handling different authentication flows securely. For Google OAuth users, a password is not stored, enhancing security. For email-based registration, it enforces the requirement of a password. This prevents inconsistent state and ensures proper authentication strategy is followed.

#### **HOW it Interacts**

The `User` model primarily interacts with itself through its `friends`, `friendRequests`, and `sentRequests` fields, allowing the application to build and query social connections. It also indirectly interacts with the `Message` model as `senderId` and `receiverId` in messages refer to `User` documents.

```javascript
// backend/src/models/user.model.js
import mongoose from "mongoose"

const  userSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
        email: { 
            type: String,
            required: true,
            unique: true
        },
        username: {
            type: String,
            required: [true, "Username is required"],
            unique: true,
            trim: true,
            minlength: [3, "Username must be at least 3 characters long"],
            maxlength: [20, "Username cannot be more than 20 characters long"]
        }
        ,
        password: {
            type: String,
            minlength: 6,
        },
        profilePic: {
            type: String,
            default: "",
        },
        friends: [{
            type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
            ref: "User",
            default: [] 
        }],
        friendRequests: [{ // Incoming friend requests
            type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
            ref: "User",
            default: []
        }],
        sentRequests: [{ // Outgoing friend requests
            type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
            ref: "User",
            default: []
        }],
        authProvider: {
            type: String,
            enum: ['email', 'google'],
            default: 'email'
        },
        googleId: {
            type: String,
            unique: true,
            sparse: true
        },
    },
    { 
        timestamps: true
    } 
);

userSchema.pre('save', async function(next) {
    if (this.authProvider === 'google' && !this.isModified('password')) {
        this.password = undefined;
    }
    if (this.authProvider === 'email' && !this.password && this.isNew) {
        return next(new Error('Password is required for email signup.'));
    }
    next();
});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);

export default User;
```

### Message Model

The `Message` model (`message.model.js`) represents individual chat messages exchanged between users.

#### **WHAT it Defines**

The `Message` schema defines the structure for message documents in the `messages` collection. It includes fields for the sender (`senderId`), receiver (`receiverId`), message content (`text`), and optional media (`image`).

#### **WHY it's Designed This Way**

*   **Clear Attribution:** `senderId` and `receiverId` fields, both `required` and referencing the `User` model, ensure that every message has a clear source and destination. This is fundamental for any messaging application.
*   **Polymorphic Content:** The `text` and `image` fields allow for messages to contain either text, an image, or potentially both, offering flexibility in message types. They are not `required`, implying a message could be just an image or just text.
*   **Relationship to Users:** Using `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` with `ref: "User"` creates a strong relationship between messages and users. This enables Mongoose's `populate` feature for efficiently fetching message details along with sender/receiver information.
*   **Timestamps:** Similar to the `User` model, `timestamps: true` adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, crucial for ordering messages chronologically in a chat interface and for auditing.

#### **HOW it Interacts**

The `Message` model interacts directly with the `User` model via its `senderId` and `receiverId` fields. This is a one-to-many relationship where one user can send/receive many messages.

```javascript
// backend/src/models/message.model.js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const messageSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
    {
     senderId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: "User",
        required: true,
     },
     receiverId: {
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
        ref: "User",
        required: true,
     },
     text: {
        type: String,
     },
     image: {
        type: String,
     },
    },
    {timestamps: true}
);

export default mongoose.model("Message", messageSchema);
```

        +String text
        +String image
        +Date createdAt
        +Date updatedAt

    User "1" --- "*" User : friends (self-referential)
```



## Key Insights and Best Practices

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The database connection logic is separated into `db.js`, distinct from the data models. This promotes modularity and makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Data Integrity & Validation:** Mongoose schemas provide robust data validation at the ODM layer, ensuring that data conforms to defined rules before being persisted in MongoDB. This reduces the risk of corrupt or incomplete data.
*   **Referential Integrity (Soft):** While MongoDB is NoSQL, Mongoose's `ObjectId` with `ref` offers a strong mechanism for defining relationships between collections. This allows for powerful `populate` operations, fetching related data efficiently, mirroring the benefits of relational joins without sacrificing MongoDB's flexibility.
*   **Scalability with Document-Oriented Design:** The models are designed to be largely self-contained yet linkable. This document-oriented approach generally scales well horizontally in MongoDB, allowing the application to handle increasing data volumes and user loads.
*   **Flexible Authentication:** The `User` model's design for `authProvider` and `pre('save')` hook demonstrates a best practice for supporting multiple authentication methods without bloating the core logic.
*   **Auditing and Time-Based Queries:** The `timestamps: true` option on both schemas is a simple yet powerful feature for tracking when documents were created and last updated, which is invaluable for auditing, debugging, and implementing time-based features (e.g., "newest messages").

By meticulously defining these data models and establishing a reliable database connection, the application lays a solid groundwork for its core functionalities, ensuring data consistency, efficient retrieval, and a flexible architecture.
