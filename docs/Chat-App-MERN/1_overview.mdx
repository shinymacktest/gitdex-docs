# MERN Chat Application Overview

<TOC />

This document provides an overview of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) chat application.  The application allows users to chat with each other in real-time.  This documentation focuses on the backend architecture and authentication mechanisms.  The frontend components are not covered in detail in this chunk.

## Architecture

The application follows a classic three-tier architecture:

````mermaid
graph TD
    A[React Frontend] --> B(Express.js Backend);
    B --> C[MongoDB Database];
    style A fill:#60a5fa;
    style B fill:#22c55e;
    style C fill:#f9f;
```

* **Frontend (React):**  Handles user interface and real-time communication via Socket.IO.  (Details not provided in this chunk)
* **Backend (Express.js):**  Manages API endpoints for authentication, user management, and potentially other features not covered in this chunk.  Uses Express.js for routing and handling requests.
* **Database (MongoDB):**  Stores user data, chat messages, and other application data.


## Backend Dependencies

The backend utilizes several key dependencies, as detailed in `backend/package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cloudinary": "^2.5.1",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.7",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "express-session": "^1.18.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.9.5",
    "passport": "^0.7.0",
    "passport-google-oauth20": "^2.0.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
  }
}
```

These dependencies facilitate user authentication (bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, passport, passport-google-oauth20), database interaction (mongoose), and image/file handling (cloudinary).  `cookie-parser` manages session cookies, while `dotenv` handles environment variables.  `socket.io` provides real-time capabilities.
