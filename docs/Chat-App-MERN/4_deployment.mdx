# Deployment and Setup

<TOC />

## System Purpose

This document outlines the setup and deployment procedures for the MERN Chat application.  The application utilizes a full-stack architecture, leveraging React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB for data persistence, and Socket.IO for real-time communication.  The application allows users to chat in real-time.


### Key Features

*   **Real-time Chat:**  Users can communicate instantly with each other.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration are implemented.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** The use of a MERN stack allows for easier scaling as the user base grows.

## Frontend Setup ([`frontend/package.json`](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/package.json))

The frontend uses React, along with several libraries for UI, routing, and state management.

### Dependencies

The frontend's `package.json` file lists its dependencies:

| Package           | Description                                     | Version |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------|

| socket.io-client   | Client-side library for Socket.IO                | 4.8.1   |
| zustand            | Small, fast, scalable state management solution | 5.0.3   |
| lucide-react       | React icon library                             | 0.471.1 |
| react-hot-toast    | React library for displaying toast notifications | 2.5.1   |
| react-icons        | React icon library                             | 5.5.0   |
| daisyui            | Tailwind CSS component library                  | 4.12.23 |


To install the frontend dependencies, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development and Build

The frontend uses Vite for development and building.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

`npm run dev` starts the development server, and `npm run build` creates a production-ready build.


## Backend Setup ([`backend/package.json`](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/backend/package.json))

The backend uses Node.js, Express.js, and several other libraries for authentication, database interaction, and real-time communication.

### Dependencies

The backend's `package.json` lists its dependencies:

| Package            | Description                               | Version |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------|
| express            | Web application framework                  | 4.21.2  |
| mongoose           | MongoDB ODM                                | 8.9.5   |
| bcryptjs           | Password hashing library                    | 2.4.3   |
| jsonwebtoken        | JSON Web Token library                     | 9.0.2   |
| cookie-parser      | Cookie parsing middleware                 | 1.4.7   |
| express-session    | Session management middleware              | 1.18.1  |
| passport           | Authentication middleware                  | 0.7.0   |
| passport-google-oauth20 | Google OAuth 2.0 strategy for Passport | 2.0.0   |
| socket.io          | Real-time communication library            | 4.8.1   |
| dotenv             | Loads environment variables from .env file | 16.4.7  |
| cloudinary         | Cloudinary image/video upload library      | 2.5.1   |


To install the backend dependencies, navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development and Startup

The backend uses `nodemon` for development and `node` for production.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

`npm run dev` starts the development server with automatic restarts on file changes, while `npm run start` starts the production server.

        E --> F[Google OAuth 2.0];
        E --> G[Local Authentication];
    end
```



## Key Integration Points

*   **Frontend and Backend Communication:** The frontend communicates with the backend using HTTP requests via Axios for data fetching and updates, and via Socket.IO for real-time messaging.
*   **Authentication Flow:** The backend utilizes Passport.js for authentication, integrating with Google OAuth 2.0 and local authentication.  Cookies and JWTs likely handle session management.
*   **Real-time Communication:**  Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional communication between the frontend and the backend, facilitating instant messaging updates.
*   **Database Interaction:** Mongoose handles interactions with the MongoDB database for data persistence.

## Best Practices

*   **Separation of Concerns:** The application follows a clear separation of concerns, with distinct frontend, backend, and database layers.
*   **Modular Design:**  The codebase is likely structured in a modular fashion, promoting maintainability and reusability.
*   **Security Considerations:** Password hashing (bcrypt), JWTs, and OAuth 2.0 authentication are important security measures implemented.

## Further Considerations

The provided code snippets give a high-level overview.  A more thorough understanding would require exploring the source code in detail.  Specifically, inspecting the implementation of the socket.io logic, the authentication strategies, and the data models within the MongoDB database would offer a deeper level of technical comprehension.
