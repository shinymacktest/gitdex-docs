# Project Overview

This document provides an overview of the "med-reminder" application, a web-based medication reminder tool. This project is built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, aiming to provide users with a user-friendly interface for managing their medication schedules. The application is designed to be a practical and helpful tool for individuals who need to take multiple medications regularly, ensuring they don't miss their doses. The codebase can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/santrupt29/med_reminder).

## Features

*   **Medication Scheduling:**  Allows users to add medications, set dosage information, and define the frequency and timing of doses.
*   **Reminders and Notifications:**  Provides timely reminders to users about their medication schedules. (Implementation details not provided in the current scope, but would likely involve browser notifications or similar).
*   **User Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface designed for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/santrupt29/med_reminder/blob/main/src/App.tsx).
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling the application.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.

## Key Files

*   **`README.md`:** Project documentation (this is where you're reading the description).
*   **`package.json`:** Contains project dependencies and scripts. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/santrupt29/med_reminder/blob/main/package.json).
*   **`package-lock.json`:** Records the exact versions of installed dependencies.

## Code Snippets

Here are a few snippets demonstrating key parts of the application's development, along with GitHub links for context.

1.  **App.tsx - Basic React Component:**

    This code snippet shows the basic structure of a React component, which acts as the entry point of the application.

    ```typescript
    // View on GitHub: https://github.com/santrupt29/med_reminder/blob/main/src/App.tsx
    import React from 'react';
    import './App.css';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <h1>Medication Reminder</h1>
          {/*  Other components will be rendered here */}
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;

    ```

    This snippet sets up the basic layout for the application, including a heading.  Further components will likely be integrated into this main structure to handle medication management and reminders.

2.  **package.json - Dependencies:**

    This snippet provides the section in `package.json` that shows the used technologies and dependencies.

    ```json
    // View on GitHub: https://github.com/santrupt29/med_reminder/blob/main/package.json
    {
      "name": "med-reminder",
      "private": true,
      "version": "0.0.0",
      "type": "module",
      "scripts": {
        "dev": "vite",
        "build": "vite build",
        "preview": "vite preview"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog": "^1.0.5",
        "@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.0.2",
        "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.0",
        "clsx": "^2.1.0",
        "framer-motion": "^12.4.0",
        "lucide-react": "^0.263.1",
        "react": "^18.2.0",
        "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
        "tailwind-merge": "^2.2.0",
        "tailwindcss-animate": "^1.0.7"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@types/react": "^18.2.48",
        "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.18",
        "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.2.1",
        "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20",
        "postcss": "^8.5.1",
        "tailwindcss": "^3.4.17",
        "vite": "^6.1.0"
      }
    }

    ```

    Shows the technologies and their related packages that are used in this project.

3.  **Tailwind CSS usage example**
    This example shows the use of tailwind classes to style a button.

    ```typescript
    // This component will likely be similar to the App.tsx from the previous code snippet, with react-dom, react and the classes provided by tailwind
    import React from 'react';

    function AddMedicationButton() {
      return (
        <button className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
          Add Medication
        </button>
      );
    }

    export default AddMedicationButton;
    ```
    This snippet showcases how Tailwind CSS classes are used to style a button. The `bg-blue-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`, `text-white`, `font-bold`, `py-2`, `px-4`, and `rounded` classes define the button's appearance and behavior on hover, using the framework's utility-first approach.
4.  **Typescript example - Defining a Medication Interface**

    Shows a simple typescript interface to define a medication
    ```typescript
    // View on GitHub: (Hypothetical, as there's no direct interface definition in the linked files, this is for demonstration)
    interface Medication {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      dosage: string;
      frequency: string;
      time: string;
    }

    export default Medication;
    ```
    Illustrates the use of TypeScript to define an interface. This particular interface lays the foundation for how medication data might be stored and handled within the application.

## Mermaid Diagrams

        B --> C["Medication Data"]
        C --> A

        B --> E["Backend (if applicable - not described in scope)"]
        E --> C
    ```



2.  **User Interaction Flow:**

    Here's a flowchart describing the core flow of user interaction with the application.

    



```mermaid

        B -- "View Schedule" --> E["Display Scheduled Doses"]
        E --> F["Receive Reminders"]
        D --> E
        F --> B
    ```



## Key Integration Points

The "med-reminder" application integrates several key components to provide a seamless experience for users.

*   **User Interface and User Interaction:** The frontend, built using React, handles the user interface and user interaction. The user can add medications or view schedule by interacting with the interface.
*   **Data Management:**  Medication data is saved to the database (not present in the scope of this project).
*   **Reminders/Notifications:** The application will display reminders based on the data that is present in the database.
*   **Backend (if applicable):** If there is any backend system (not present in the scope of this project) it will be used for data storage and retrieval, potentially handling more complex logic for reminders and user accounts.

The best practices would consist of:

*   **Component Reusability:** Creating reusable React components to make the UI more efficient.
*   **State Management:** Use React state to manage the application state and the data for the reminders.
*   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation to ensure that medication details entered by the user are valid.
*   **Accessibility:** Design and implement components with accessibility in mind, adhering to the necessary accessibility standards.
