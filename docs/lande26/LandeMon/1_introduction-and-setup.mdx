## 🚀 Initial Setup and Configuration

To get Landemon up and running, whether for local development or deployment, follow these instructions.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher.
*   **npm or Yarn**: Your preferred Node.js package manager.
*   **TMDb API Key**: A free API key from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup). This is essential for fetching movie data.

### Local Development

For developing on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lande26/movieko.git
    cd movieko
    ```
    This command fetches the project source code to your machine and navigates into the project directory.

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you prefer yarn
    yarn install
    ```
    This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all required dependencies. [View `package.json` on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko/blob/main/package.json).

3.  **Configure environment variables**:
    Landemon requires specific environment variables to function correctly. Copy the example environment file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Then, open the newly created `.env` file and update the values:
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_TOKEN=your_tmdb_api_key_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Landemon
    ```
    Replace `your_tmdb_api_key_here` with the API Read Access Token (v4 auth) obtained from TMDb. A default token is available in `.env.example` for testing purposes, but your own key is recommended for production.

4.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    This command starts the Next.js development server. You can then access the application by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

### Production Build

To prepare Landemon for production deployment, use the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Deployment

Landemon can be easily deployed to various platforms. Vercel is recommended due to its tight integration with Next.js.

#### Deploy with Vercel (Recommended)

Clicking the "Deploy with Vercel" button in the README automatically sets up a new project.
[View Deploy Button on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko#quick-deploy).

After clicking, you'll need to:
1.  Sign in to Vercel (or create an account).
2.  The repository will be forked to your GitHub account.
3.  Configure the environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_TOKEN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME`) in Vercel.
4.  Click "Deploy" and wait for the build to complete.

#### Deploy with Cloudflare Pages

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Log in to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).
3.  Create a new project and connect your forked repository.
4.  Configure build settings:
    *   **Framework preset**: Next.js
    *   **Build command**: `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages@1`
    *   **Build output directory**: `.vercel/output/static`
5.  Add the same environment variables as for Vercel.
6.  Click "Save and Deploy".

## 📚 Project Structure and Relevant Files

### `README.md`

The `README.md` file serves as the project's primary entry point for anyone interested in Landemon. It provides a comprehensive overview, covering:

*   Project title and description.
*   Key features.
*   Quick deployment options (Vercel, Cloudflare Pages).
*   Detailed local development setup instructions.
*   Explanation of environment variables and how to obtain a TMDb API key.
*   The tech stack used.
*   Contribution guidelines.
*   License information and acknowledgements.

This file is crucial for onboarding new developers and users, acting as a living document that guides interaction with the project.

### `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

These files are fundamental for managing the project's dependencies and scripts.

*   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, scripts, and direct dependencies.
    *   **Dependencies**: Lists all runtime libraries and frameworks, such as `next`, `react`, `axios`, `@radix-ui/react-accordion`, `framer-motion`, `tailwind-merge`, and `zod`.
    *   **Dev Dependencies**: Specifies tools used only during development, like `autoprefixer`, `eslint`, `husky`, `lint-staged`, `postcss`, `prettier`, and `typescript`.
    *   **Scripts**: Defines convenient commands for development, building, linting, formatting, and type-checking. [View `package.json` on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko/blob/main/package.json).

*   **`package-lock.json`**: Ensures consistent installations across different environments. It records the exact versions of all dependencies, including sub-dependencies, used during the last `npm install` operation. This prevents unexpected behavior due to dependency version mismatches. [View `package-lock.json` on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko/blob/main/package-lock.json).

### `.lintstagedrc.js`

This configuration file defines commands to run against staged Git files. It's used in conjunction with `husky` to enforce code quality standards before commits are finalized.

```javascript
// .lintstagedrc.js
const path = require('path');

const buildEslintCommand = (filenames) =>
  `next lint --fix --file ${filenames
    .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))
    .join(' --file ')}`;

module.exports = {
  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': [buildEslintCommand],
  '*.{css,scss,sass,less,styl,json,js,tsx,ts,cjs,mjs}': ['prettier --write'],
};
```
[View `.lintstagedrc.js` on GitHub](https://github.com/lande26/movieko/blob/main/.lintstagedrc.js).

This configuration specifies two types of tasks:
*   For JavaScript/TypeScript files (`*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`): It runs `next lint --fix` to automatically fix linting issues. The `buildEslintCommand` function ensures that only staged files are linted.
*   For various styling and configuration files (`*.{css,scss,sass,less,styl,json,js,tsx,ts,cjs,mjs}`): It runs `prettier --write` to automatically format these files according to the project's Prettier configuration.

## 🔑 Key Integration Points

Landemon's architecture relies on several integrations to deliver its full functionality:

### Local Development Workflow
The local development process is streamlined using Node.js tools.

    B --> C["Copies .env.example to .env"]
    C --> D{"Configures API Key in .env"}
    D -- "Success" --> E["Starts Dev Server (npm run dev)"]
    D -- "Missing Key" --> D
    E --> F["Accesses App via Browser"]
```



### CI/CD and Code Quality

The project integrates `husky` and `lint-staged` for automated code quality checks, ensuring that only well-formatted and lint-free code makes it into the repository. This improves maintainability and reduces technical debt.





```mermaid

    participant Dev as "Developer"
    participant Git as "Git"
    participant Husky as "Husky Hook"
    participant LintStaged as "lint-staged"
    participant ESLint as "ESLint"
    participant Prettier as "Prettier"

    Dev ->> Git: git commit -m "feat: my feature"
    Git ->> Husky: Pre-commit hook triggered
    Husky ->> LintStaged: Runs configured tasks
    LintStaged ->> ESLint: Lints staged JS/TS files
    LintStaged ->> Prettier: Formats staged files
    ESLint -->> LintStaged: Reports/fixes errors
    Prettier -->> LintStaged: Applies formatting
    LintStaged -->> Husky: All tasks complete (or fail)
    alt On Success
        Husky ->> Git: Allows commit
        Git -->> Dev: Commit successful
    else On Failure
        Husky ->> Dev: Blocks commit with errors
    end
```


**Explanation**: When a developer attempts to commit, `husky` intercepts the action. `lint-staged` then identifies relevant staged files and applies `ESLint` for linting (with auto-fix) and `Prettier` for formatting. If all checks pass, the commit proceeds. If errors remain, the commit is blocked, providing immediate feedback to the developer.

### Environment Variable Management

The use of `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` and `.env` files is a crucial practice for managing sensitive information and configuration differences between environments.

*   **Security**: Keeps API keys and other sensitive data out of the codebase, preventing accidental exposure in version control.
*   **Flexibility**: Allows different values for development, staging, and production environments without code changes.
*   **Best Practice**: Adheres to the 12 Factor App principles for configuration.

Always ensure that your `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data from being committed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Summary

Landemon is built upon a robust and modern tech stack:

*   **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router for server-side rendering and static site generation.
*   **TypeScript**: Enhances code quality and maintainability with static type checking.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
