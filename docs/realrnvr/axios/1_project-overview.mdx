## Project Setup Highlights

Setting up the project involves cloning the repository, installing dependencies for both client and server, and then running each part separately.

#### Client Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rushichavan21/axios.git

# Navigate to the client directory
cd axios/client

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```
[View client setup instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/rushichavan21/axios#project-setup)

#### Server Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd axios/server

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Start the backend server (using nodemon for auto-restarts)
npm start
```
[View server setup instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/rushichavan21/axios#project-setup)

This setup ensures that both the frontend and backend services are running, allowing the application to function correctly. The frontend will typically run on a different port (e.g., `localhost:5173` via Vite), while the backend runs on its designated port (e.g., `localhost:5000` or as configured in `index.js`).

## Future Enhancements

The project has a clear roadmap for future development:

*   **AI-driven Transcription and Summarization**: Implement AI to transcribe meeting audio and generate concise summaries.
*   **Expanded Language Support**: Increase accessibility by supporting multiple languages.
*   **Optimized Video Streaming**: Enhance video quality and reduce bandwidth usage, especially for low-bandwidth connections.
*   **Cloud-based Code Session Storage**: Allow users to save and retrieve code sessions from the cloud.

## Key Integration Points

The seamless functionality of EnterAct Video relies on several critical integration points:

### 1. Stream.io SDK Integration
The Stream.io SDK is fundamental to EnterAct Video's real-time capabilities.
*   **Frontend**: The `@stream-io/video-react-sdk` provides React hooks and components for easily integrating video calls, chat, and participant management into the UI. This abstracts away the complexities of WebRTC and real-time communication.
*   **Backend**: The `@stream-io/node-sdk` is used on the server to generate authentication tokens for users, manage Stream.io resources (e.g., creating channels, updating user metadata), and handle server-side events if necessary. This ensures secure and controlled access to Stream.io services.
    ```javascript
    // Example from a server-side Stream.io token generation (conceptual)
    import { StreamChat } from 'stream-chat';
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    dotenv.config();

    const api_key = process.env.STREAM_API_KEY;
    const api_secret = process.env.STREAM_API_SECRET;

    const serverClient = StreamChat.getInstance(api_key, api_secret);

    // In an API endpoint:
    app.post('/api/create-token', (req, res) => {
        const { userId } = req.body;
        const expirationTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (60 * 60); // 1 hour
        const issuedAt = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) - 60; // 1 minute ago

        const token = serverClient.createToken(userId, expirationTime, issuedAt);
        res.json({ token });
    });
    ```
    This snippet demonstrates how the backend acts as a secure intermediary to generate user-specific tokens for Stream.io, preventing API secrets from being exposed on the client.

### 2. Real-time Code Editor (Code Mirror)
The integration of Code Mirror is crucial for the collaborative coding feature.
*   **Frontend**: Code Mirror is embedded as a component within the React application. To achieve real-time collaboration, a synchronization mechanism (often using WebSockets, possibly via Stream.io's messaging capabilities or a dedicated WebSocket server) is implemented to broadcast changes made by one user to all other participants.
*   **Operational Transformation/Conflict Resolution**: For true real-time collaborative editing, a robust system for handling concurrent edits is essential. This typically involves Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to ensure consistency across all clients.

### 3. User Authentication (Auth0)
Auth0 provides a secure and scalable authentication solution.
*   **Frontend**: The `@auth0/auth0-react` SDK is used to handle login, logout, and manage user sessions within the React application. It redirects users to the Auth0 universal login page and provides mechanisms to access user profile information and authentication tokens.
    ```javascript
    // Example of Auth0Provider in client/src/main.jsx (conceptual)
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
    import App from './App.jsx';
    import { Auth0Provider } from '@auth0/auth0-react';

    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <Auth0Provider
          domain={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN}
          clientId={import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}
          authorizationParams={{
            redirect_uri: window.location.origin
          }}
        >
          <App />
        </Auth0Provider>
      </React.StrictMode>,
    );
    ```
    This shows how the `Auth0Provider` wraps the main application, making authentication contexts available throughout.
*   **Backend**: The backend can validate incoming tokens issued by Auth0 to secure API endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive resources.

## Workflow for a New Meeting





```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User Logs In (Auth0)"] --> B["Frontend Initiates Stream Client"];
    B --> C["Backend Requests Stream Token"];
    C --> D["Stream.io Node SDK Generates Token"];
    D --> C;
    C --> B;
    B --> E["Frontend Connects to Stream.io"];
    E --> F["User Joins/Creates Meeting Channel"];
    F --> G["Participants Interact (Video, Chat, Code)"];
    G --> E;
```


This sequence details the typical workflow when a user initiates or joins a meeting. After logging in via Auth0, the frontend requests a Stream.io token from the backend. The backend securely generates this token, allowing the frontend to establish a secure connection to Stream.io. Once connected, users can join or create meeting channels and begin collaborating through video, chat, and the real-time code editor.
