# Frontend Development

<TOC />

## System Purpose

The frontend of this application provides the user interface and handles all client-side interactions, offering a dynamic and responsive experience. It is built using React, a declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building UIs, and leverages Vite for a fast development experience. The primary goals include:

*   **User Authentication and Authorization**: Facilitating user registration, login, and session management to secure access to application features. ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/src/App.jsx#L19-L21))
*   **Dynamic Routing**: Managing navigation between different application views (e.g., Home, Login, Profile, Settings) using `react-router-dom`. ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/src/App.jsx#L35-L42))
*   **State Management**: Utilizing Zustand for efficient and simple global state management, particularly for authentication status and theme preferences. ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/src/App.jsx#L18-L19))
*   **Real-time Communication**: Interacting with a backend WebSocket server (Socket.IO) to handle real-time updates and notifications.
*   **User Profile and Settings Management**: Providing interfaces for users to view and modify their profile details and application settings.

## System Architecture Overview

The frontend operates as the presentation layer in a typical client-server architecture. It communicates asynchronously with the backend API to fetch and submit data. Authentication states are managed client-side, with validations and data persistence handled on the server. The application is structured to ensure a clear separation of concerns, where components are responsible for rendering UI, and services or stores handle data fetching and state updates.

**`package.json` Dependencies Snippet:**
This snippet from `package.json` shows the primary dependencies that form the runtime core of the frontend application. These packages are essential for rendering UI, handling network requests, managing state, and providing real-time features.

**`vite.config.js` Configuration:**
The `vite.config.js` file is minimal, primarily configuring Vite to use the `@vitejs/plugin-react` plugin. This plugin enables React Fast Refresh and ensures proper handling of React JSX syntax during the build process.
```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
})
```

## Core Application Features

The frontend application provides a rich set of features, centrally managed by `App.jsx`, which orchestrates routing, authentication checks, and global state initialization.

*   **Global Authentication Check**: On application load, `App.jsx` triggers `checkAuth` from `useAuthStore` to verify the user's authentication status. This ensures that protected routes are only accessible to logged-in users.
    ```jsx
    const App = () => {
      const { authUser, checkAuth, isCheckingAuth, onlineUsers } = useAuthStore();
      const { theme } = useThemeStore();
      useEffect(() => {
        checkAuth();
      }, [checkAuth]);
    
      console.log("authUser: ", {authUser});
    
      console.log({onlineUsers})
    
      if(isCheckingAuth && !authUser) return (
          <div className='flex items-center justify-center h-screen'>
            <Loader className='size-10 animate-spin' />
          </div>
      )
    // ... rest of the component
    ```
    ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/src/App.jsx#L17-L31))

*   **Conditional Routing**: `react-router-dom` is used to define public and private routes. Users are redirected based on their authentication status, enhancing security and user experience. For instance, `/` (homepage) is only accessible to authenticated users, while `/login` and `/signup` are for unauthenticated users.
    ```jsx
    <Routes>
      <Route path='/' element={authUser ? <HomePage />: <Navigate to='/login' />} />
      <Route path='/signup' element={ !authUser ? <SignUpPage />: <Navigate to='/' />} />
      <Route path='/login' element={!authUser ? <LoginPage />: <Navigate to='/' />} />
      <Route path='/settings' element={<SettingsPage />} />
      <Route path='/profile' element={authUser ? <ProfilePage />: <Navigate to='/login' />} />
    </Routes>
    ```
    ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/src/App.jsx#L35-L42))

*   **Global Theme Management**: The application uses Zustand (`useThemeStore`) to manage the current theme, allowing users to switch between themes (e.g., dark/light mode). The `data-theme` attribute on the root `div` ensures consistent styling across the application using DaisyUI.
    ```jsx
    const App = () => {
      const { authUser, checkAuth, isCheckingAuth, onlineUsers } = useAuthStore();
      const { theme } = useThemeStore(); // Theme is retrieved from here
      useEffect(() => {
        checkAuth();
      }, [checkAuth]);
    
      // ...
    
      return (
        <div className='' data-theme={theme}> {/* Theme applied here */}
          <Navbar />
          <Toaster />
          {/* ... Routes */}
        </div> 
      )
    }
    ```

## Key Integration Points

*   **Authentication Flow**: The frontend initiates login/signup requests to the backend API via Axios. Upon successful authentication, the backend typically sends back user data or a token, which the frontend stores (e.g., in local storage or a Zustand store) to maintain the user's session. The `useAuthStore` manages this process, including fetching user details and handling logout. Best practice here is to use secure HTTP-only cookies for tokens to prevent XSS attacks.

*   **State Management with Zustand**: Zustand is crucial for managing global states like `authUser`, `isCheckingAuth`, `theme`, and `onlineUsers`. Its lightweight nature helps avoid unnecessary re-renders and keeps the application performant. Separating concerns into different stores (e.g., `useAuthStore`, `useThemeStore`) promotes modularity and maintainability.

*   **Routing with React Router DOM v6**: The application uses the latest features of `react-router-dom` for declarative and efficient client-side routing. The use of `<Navigate />` components for redirection based on authentication status is a clean way to handle route protection.

*   **Build Process with Vite**: Vite provides an extremely fast development server and an optimized build process. By using native ES modules in development and Rollup for production builds, it significantly improves developer experience and application performance. The `vite.config.js` is minimal, relying on `@vitejs/plugin-react` for React-specific optimizations.

*   **Styling with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI**: The combination of Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and DaisyUI for pre-built components (built on Tailwind) allows for rapid UI development and easy theme customization. The `data-theme` attribute on the root `div` in `App.jsx` demonstrates how DaisyUI themes are applied globally.
