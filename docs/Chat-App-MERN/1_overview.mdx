# Overview

<TOC />

This document provides an overview of the Chat-App-MERN project, a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  The project leverages several libraries and technologies to facilitate user authentication, real-time communication, and data persistence. The application's architecture is divided into a frontend (React) and a backend (Node.js with Express.js).  This section will outline the project structure and dependencies.

## Project Structure

The project is comprised of two main parts: a frontend located in the `frontend` directory and a backend in the `backend` directory.  The root directory contains a `package.json` file to manage the build process for both parts.

    B --> D[README.md];
    B --> E[src/];
    C --> F[package.json];
    C --> G[src/index.js];
```

The `package.json` in the root directory orchestrates the build process.  It uses npm scripts to handle dependencies and the execution of both the frontend and backend builds.  Let's examine the root `package.json` in detail:

```json
{
  "name": "chatapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build" : "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start" : "npm run start --prefix backend"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

The `build` script first installs the dependencies for the backend and frontend separately, then builds the frontend application. The `start` script simply starts the backend server.  This separation ensures that both parts are built correctly and independently before running the application.

## Frontend Overview ([Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend))

The frontend, built with React and Vite, utilizes a minimal setup for rapid development.  The `frontend/README.md` mentions the use of either `@vitejs/plugin-react` or `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for fast refresh capabilities.  These plugins provide efficient development workflows using either Babel or SWC for transpilation.

    C --> D[Chat UI];
    C --> E[Auth UI];
    E --> F[API Calls (Backend)];
    D --> F;
```

The frontend interacts with the backend to handle user authentication and data retrieval. The chat UI component is responsible for displaying and handling chat messages, leveraging the backend API to send and receive messages in real-time through Socket.IO.


## Backend Overview ([Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/backend))

The backend, built with Node.js and Express.js, utilizes several crucial packages to manage user accounts, authentication, and real-time communication.  The `backend/package.json` file lists these dependencies:


```json
{
  "name": "backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon src/index.js",
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  },
  "author": "",
  "type": "module",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": "",
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "cloudinary": "^2.5.1",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.7",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "express-session": "^1.18.1",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.9.5",
    "passport": "^0.7.0",
    "passport-google-oauth20": "^2.0.0",
    "socket.io": "^4.8.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9"
  }
}
```

Notable dependencies include `mongoose` for database interaction (likely MongoDB), `express` for the web server, `passport` and `passport-google-oauth20` for Google OAuth authentication, `jsonwebtoken` for generating access tokens, `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `socket.io` for real-time communication, and `cloudinary` for potentially handling image uploads.  `dotenv` is used for managing environment variables.  `nodemon` simplifies development by automatically restarting the server upon code changes.

## Dependencies and Technologies

The project uses a combination of frontend and backend technologies to create a fully functional chat application.  The use of  Socket.IO ensures real-time communication between the client and server, while Passport.js simplifies authentication.  The project's structure allows for scalability and maintainability.
