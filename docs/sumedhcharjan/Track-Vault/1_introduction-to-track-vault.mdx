## Application Structure

Track-Vault follows the Next.js App Router structure, organizing components and routes logically. The core layout and homepage provide a clear entry point into the application's design.

### Root Layout (`src/app/layout.jsx`)

The main layout wraps the entire application, providing common elements like navigation, a footer, and global providers. It also sets up global styling and metadata.

```jsx showLineNumbers {13-24}
// src/app/layout.jsx
import Footer from "@/components/Footer";
import "../styles/globals.css";
import Navbar from "@/components/Navbar";
import { Providers } from "@/components/Provider";
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { Toaster } from "sonner";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = {
  title: "Track Vault - Secure File Sharing",
  description: "Share files securely with expiry rules and real-time analytics",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body
        className={cn(
          "min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-background font-sans antialiased",
          inter.className
        )}
      >
        <Providers>
            <Toaster/>
          <Navbar />
          <main className="flex-1">{children}</main>
          <Footer />
        </Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Homepage (`src/app/page.jsx`)

The application's landing page serves as the entry point for unauthenticated users, showcasing key features and prompting login/registration. For authenticated users, it redirects to the dashboard, indicating an authenticated state managed by Kinde.

```jsx showLineNumbers {7-11,29-41}
// src/app/page.jsx
import { getKindeServerSession } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/server";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import { RegisterLink, LoginLink } from "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs/components";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { ArrowRight, ShieldCheck, BarChart, Zap } from "lucide-react";
import { FlickeringGrid } from "@/components/ui/flickering-grid";

export default async function Home() {
  const { getUser } = getKindeServerSession();
  const user = await getUser();

  if (user) {
    redirect("/dashboard");
  }

  return (
    <main className="relative flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-screen overflow-hidden bg-background pt-16">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-0">

## Getting Started

To set up Track-Vault for development or deployment, certain prerequisites must be met, followed by the standard installation process.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher.
*   **AWS S3 Bucket:** An Amazon S3 bucket configured with appropriate credentials for file storage.
*   **Supabase Project:** A Supabase project set up for managing file metadata, user information, and analytics.
*   **EC2 Instance (for deployment):** An AWS EC2 instance if you plan to deploy the application in a production environment.

### Installation

Follow these steps to get a local copy of Track-Vault running:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/track-vault.git
    cd track-vault
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs all necessary project dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Key Integration Points

Track-Vault relies heavily on seamless integration between its Next.js frontend/backend and various external services.

### Authentication Flow

User authentication is a critical component, managed through Kinde or Supabase Auth. This ensures secure access to file management and analytics features.





```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Client (Browser)"] -->|"1. Initiates Login/Register"| B["Next.js Frontend (LoginLink/RegisterLink)"]
    B -->|"2. Redirects to Auth Provider"| C["Kinde / Supabase Auth Service"]
    C -->|"3. User Authenticates"| C
    C -->|"4. Redirects to Next.js Frontend with Auth Callback"| B
    B -->|"5. `getKindeServerSession()` on Server"| D["Next.js Server (API Route / `page.jsx`)"]
    D -->|"6. Fetches User Session / Profile"| E["Supabase (Database)"]
    E -->|"7. Returns User Data"| D
    D -->|"8. Renders Dashboard / Sets User Context"| F["Client (Dashboard)"]
```



The `getKindeServerSession` function, as seen in `src/app/page.jsx`, is central to verifying user authentication on the server side, enabling protected routes and personalized content.

### File Storage and Access

Files are securely stored in AWS S3, with access mediated by signed URLs generated by the Next.js backend to ensure private access control. This method prevents direct public access to files while allowing authenticated users to download or view them temporarily.

### Data Management

Supabase acts as the central database for user profiles, file metadata, and analytics data. This allows for real-time tracking of file interactions (views, downloads) and provides the foundation for the analytics dashboard.
