# Project Overview

<TOC />

This document provides an overview of the MERN stack chat application.  The application consists of a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and a MongoDB database.  The frontend handles user interaction and displays messages, while the backend manages authentication, messaging logic, and database interactions.

## Architecture

The application's architecture can be visualized as follows:

````mermaid

    A[React Frontend] --> B(Express.js Backend);
    B --> C[MongoDB Database];
    style A fill:#60a5fa;
    style B fill:#22c55e;
    style C fill:#4ade80;
```

This diagram shows the data flow between the frontend, backend, and database. The frontend sends requests to the backend, which then interacts with the database to retrieve and store data.
