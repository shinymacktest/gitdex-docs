# Project Overview

<TOC />

This document provides an overview of the MERN stack chat application.  The application utilizes React for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.  This initial documentation focuses on the frontend architecture and state management.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into `frontend` and `backend` directories (although only the `frontend` is detailed in this input). The `frontend` directory contains the React application's source code, including components, styling, and configuration files.  Key files include:

* `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts. [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/package.json)
* `frontend/src/store`: Contains Zustand stores for managing application state.
* `frontend/tailwind.config.js`: Configures Tailwind CSS for styling.
* `frontend/vite.config.js`: Configuration file for the Vite build tool.


## Frontend Technology Stack

The frontend uses the following technologies:

* **React:**  For building the user interface.
* **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
* **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **DaisyUI:** A Tailwind CSS component library.
* **Vite:** A fast build tool for development and production.
