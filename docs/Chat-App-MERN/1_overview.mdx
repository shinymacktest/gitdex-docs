# MERN Chat App Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) chat application.  The application allows users to create accounts, add friends, and exchange text and image messages. Authentication is handled via email/password and Google OAuth.

The project is structured into a frontend (React) and a backend (Node.js with Express.js).  This documentation focuses on the backend.
