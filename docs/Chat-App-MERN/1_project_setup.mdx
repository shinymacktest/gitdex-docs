# Project Setup & Build

This section covers the foundational aspects of the project, including its overall structure, build scripts, and key frontend development configurations like Vite.

## Project Structure and Build Scripts

The `package.json` file in the root directory defines the project's metadata and essential scripts for building and starting the application. It highlights a monorepo-like structure where separate `backend` and `frontend` directories contain their respective `package.json` files and dependencies.

The main `package.json` provides convenience scripts to manage these sub-projects:

```json
{
  "name": "chatapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build" : "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start" : "npm run start --prefix backend"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}
```

-   `npm run build`: This script first installs dependencies for both the `backend` and `frontend` sub-projects, and then triggers the build process specifically for the `frontend`.
-   `npm run start`: This script initiates the backend server, assuming its dependencies are already installed and it's ready to run.

### Build Process Flow

The `build` script orchestrates the setup and compilation of the application components.

    A[Start Build Script] --> B{Install Backend Dependencies?};
    B --> C[npm install --prefix backend];
    C --> D{Install Frontend Dependencies?};
    D --> E[npm install --prefix frontend];
    E --> F[npm run build --prefix frontend];
    F --> G[Frontend Build Artifacts];
    G --> H[End Build Script];
```
The `package-lock.json` file ensures consistent dependency versions across different environments, locking down the exact versions of all installed packages.

## Frontend Development Configuration (Vite)

The frontend application utilizes [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as its build tool, known for its fast development server and optimized build output. The `vite.config.js` file at the root of the `frontend` directory defines the configurations specific to Vite.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
})
```
[Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/vite.config.js)

Key aspects configured here include:
-   **`defineConfig`**: A helper from Vite to ensure proper type inference for configuration options.
-   **`plugins: [react()]`**: Integrates the official `@vitejs/plugin-react` plugin, enabling support for React Fast Refresh and optimized builds for React applications.

This minimal configuration indicates a straightforward React setup, leveraging Vite's sensible defaults for development and production builds.
