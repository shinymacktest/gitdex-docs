# Frontend Styling & Utilities
<TOC />

## Frontend Styling with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

The frontend of this application leverages a modern, utility-first approach to styling, combining Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI. This combination allows for rapid UI development, extensive customization, and a comprehensive set of pre-built, themeable components. The `tailwind.config.js` file serves as the central configuration hub, defining how Tailwind CSS processes the application's styles, including content scanning, theme extensions, and plugin integrations.

The setup ensures that all styling is declarative and component-based where necessary, promoting consistency and maintainability. It integrates Google Fonts for custom typography, ensuring brand consistency across the user interface.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

The `tailwind.config.js` file is crucial for customizing Tailwind CSS. It specifies the files to scan for Tailwind classes (`content`), extends the default theme (e.g., adding custom `fontFamily`), and registers plugins like DaisyUI. The DaisyUI integration is particularly powerful, enabling a wide array of ready-to-use components and themes with minimal effort. The configuration explicitly lists numerous DaisyUI themes, allowing for dynamic theme switching and a rich user experience.

```javascript
// frontend/tailwind.config.js
import daisyui from "daisyui"

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily : {
        chivo : ['Chivo', 'sans-serif'],
      }
    },
  },
  plugins: [daisyui],
  daisyui : {
    themes: [
      "light", "dark", "cupcake", "bumblebee", "emerald", "corporate",
      "synthwave", "retro", "cyberpunk", "valentine", "halloween", "garden",
      "forest", "aqua", "lofi", "pastel", "fantasy", "wireframe", "black",
      "luxury", "dracula", "cmyk", "autumn", "business", "acid", "lemonade",
      "night", "coffee", "winter", "dim", "nord", "sunset",
    ],
  }
}
```

### Global Styles and Font Import

The `index.css` file is the entry point for global styles. It imports the 'Chivo' font from Google Fonts, ensuring that the custom typography is available throughout the application. It then imports Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` layers, which are essential for Tailwind CSS to inject its styles. A `@layer base` rule is used to apply the 'Chivo' font to the `body` element globally, establishing a consistent default typeface.

```css
/* frontend/src/index.css */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Chivo:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap');
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
    body {
        @apply font-chivo;
    }
}
```

## API Communication Setup with Axios

Effective communication with the backend API is fundamental for any dynamic web application. The frontend establishes a robust and configurable API client using Axios, a popular promise-based HTTP client. The `axios.js` file centralizes the configuration of the Axios instance, allowing for consistent API request handling across the application.

This centralized approach simplifies API calls, manages environment-specific base URLs, and ensures that credentials (like cookies for session management) are sent securely with each request. This design pattern promotes code reusability and maintainability for all backend interactions.

### Centralized Axios Instance

The `axiosInstance` is configured to handle API requests. A key feature is its dynamic `baseURL`, which adjusts based on the application's environment (`development` or `production`). In development, it points to `http://localhost:5001/api`, while in production, it uses a relative path `/api`, suitable for proxying or direct deployment. The `withCredentials: true` option is vital for applications relying on cookie-based authentication or session management, as it ensures that cookies are sent with cross-origin requests.

```javascript
// frontend/src/lib/axios.js
import axios from "axios";

export const axiosInstance = axios.create({
    baseURL: import.meta.env.MODE == "development" ? "http://localhost:5001/api": "/api",
    withCredentials: true,
});
```

### API Client Configuration Flow

The diagram below illustrates the logic for configuring the Axios instance's `baseURL` based on the application's environment mode.





```mermaid

  Start[Application Initialization] --> CheckEnv{Is import.meta.env.MODE == "development"?}
  CheckEnv -- Yes --> DevBaseURL["baseURL: 'http://localhost:5001/api'"]
  CheckEnv -- No --> ProdBaseURL["baseURL: '/api'"]
  DevBaseURL --> AxiosConfig[Create axiosInstance]
  ProdBaseURL --> AxiosConfig
  AxiosConfig --> End[axiosInstance Ready for Requests]
```



## General Utility Functions

To maintain a clean codebase and promote reusability, common helper functions are consolidated into `lib/utils.js`. This separation of concerns ensures that components remain focused on their core responsibilities, while generic tasks like data formatting are handled by dedicated utilities.

### Message Time Formatting

The `formatMessageTime` function is a practical example of a utility. It takes a date string or object and formats it into a human-readable string, including year, month, day, and a 12-hour time format with AM/PM. This ensures consistency in how message timestamps are displayed across the application, improving the user experience.

```javascript
// frontend/src/lib/utils.js
export function formatMessageTime(date) {
    return new Date(date).toLocaleTimeString("en-US", {
        year: "numeric",
        month: "short",
        day:"2-digit",
        hour: "2-digit",
        minute: "2-digit",
        hour12: true,
    });
}
```

## Key Integration Points

The provided frontend files demonstrate crucial aspects of frontend development: styling, API communication, and utility functions. These components integrate seamlessly to form a cohesive and maintainable application.

*   **Styling & UI Consistency:** Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI form the backbone of the application's visual presentation. `tailwind.config.js` acts as the central control for themes, fonts, and component styles. `index.css` ensures global styles and font imports are consistently applied. This setup promotes a uniform look and feel, while DaisyUI accelerates development with its ready-made, themeable components. The separation of configuration from global imports ensures scalability and modularity in styling.

*   **Robust API Communication:** The `axiosInstance` in `axios.js` is a critical integration point for all data exchanges with the backend. Its conditional `baseURL` demonstrates a best practice for handling different environments (development vs. production), preventing manual changes during deployment. The `withCredentials: true` setting is essential for secure, stateful interactions, enabling cookie-based authentication or session management without explicit token handling in every request. This centralized setup simplifies API calls and enhances maintainability.

*   **Reusable Utility Functions:** The `utils.js` file serves as a repository for general-purpose functions that can be used across various components. The `formatMessageTime` function is a prime example, ensuring that timestamps are consistently formatted. This separation of concerns improves code readability, reduces duplication, and makes testing individual functionalities easier.

**Best Practices:**
*   **Separation of Concerns:** By dedicating files to styling configuration (`tailwind.config.js`), global styles (`index.css`), API client setup (`axios.js`), and utility functions (`utils.js`), the codebase maintains clear boundaries, making it easier to understand, manage, and extend.
*   **Scalability & Maintainability:** The utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS, coupled with DaisyUI's component system, promotes highly maintainable and scalable UI development. Centralizing the Axios instance and utility functions ensures that changes to API endpoints or common logic can be made in one place, minimizing the risk of inconsistencies.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The dynamic `baseURL` in `axios.js` highlights the importance of environment-aware configuration, a critical practice for deploying applications reliably across different stages (development, staging, production).
