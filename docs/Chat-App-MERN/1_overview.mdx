# Project Overview

<TOC />

This document provides an overview of the MERN stack chat application.  The application allows users to create accounts, log in, and communicate with their friends.  The core architecture utilizes a three-tier design: a React frontend for user interaction, an Express.js backend for API handling, and a MongoDB database for persistent data storage.

## Key Features

*   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using email and password, and integrated Google authentication.  [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx)
*   **Real-time Chat:** Enables users to engage in real-time text-based conversations with their friends.
*   **Friend Management:**  Users can manage their friend list.  [Source](https://github.com/shinymack/Chat-App-MERN/blob/main/frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx)
*   **User Interface:**  Clean and intuitive user interface built with Tailwind CSS and Lucide React icons.
