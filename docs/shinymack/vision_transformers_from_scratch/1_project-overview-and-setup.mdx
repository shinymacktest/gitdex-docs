# Project Overview and Setup

This project, "Vision Transformers From Scratch," aims to generate descriptive captions for images by implementing Vision Transformers (ViT) from the ground up. It builds upon an initial baseline using a CNN + LSTM architecture.

## Project Aim and Description

The primary goal is to leverage the power of Transformers in computer vision for image captioning. The project explores both a traditional CNN + LSTM approach for baseline performance and a more advanced Vision Transformer (ViT) model, renowned for its ability to capture long-range dependencies in visual data.

## Tech Stack

The project utilizes a robust set of tools and libraries for development:

### Programming Language

*   **Python**: The core programming language for all implementations.

### Deep Learning Frameworks

*   **PyTorch**: The primary framework for building and training the deep learning models.
*   **TensorFlow / Keras**: Also supported for model implementation and experimentation.

### Data Handling and Processing

*   **NumPy**: For efficient numerical operations and array manipulation.
*   **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks.

### Natural Language Processing

*   **NLTK**: A comprehensive library for natural language processing tasks.

## Dataset

The project is trained and evaluated on the **COCO 2017 dataset**. This dataset is known for its rich annotations, providing five descriptive captions per image, which is ideal for training captioning models.

## Getting Started

To set up the project and begin running the code, follow these steps:

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shinymack/vision_transformers_from_scratch.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd vision_transformers_from_scratch
    ```

### Key Takeaways

*   The project provides a comprehensive implementation of image captioning using both CNN+LSTM and Vision Transformers.
*   It emphasizes building ViT from scratch, offering insights into its internal workings.
*   The COCO 2017 dataset is used for training and evaluation.

### Integration Details

The project is structured to allow for experimentation with different model architectures. The core logic for data loading, model definition, training, and inference is contained within the project files. Users are encouraged to explore the code to understand the implementation details of the CNN+LSTM and ViT models.
