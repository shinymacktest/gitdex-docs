# Dashboard Components

This section details the components that make up the dashboard of the AI Resume Screener application, outlining their functionalities and how they contribute to the overall user experience. The dashboard provides a central hub for managing job postings, reviewing applications, and analyzing candidate resumes.

## Analysis Results Component

The `AnalysisResults` component, located at `frontend/src/components/Dashboard/AnalysisResults.jsx`, is responsible for displaying the results of the AI-powered resume analysis. It visualizes key metrics and provides insights into candidate performance.

**Functionality:**

*   **Data Fetching:** Uses the `useAnalysisResults` hook to fetch analysis data based on the `jobId` parameter obtained from the URL using `useParams`.
*   **Loading and Error Handling:** Displays a loading spinner while data is being fetched and handles potential errors with an informative message.
*   **Data Visualization:**  Presents the analysis results using charts from the `recharts` library. It includes:
    *   A bar chart comparing candidate match scores and similarity scores.
    *   A pie chart showing the distribution of application statuses (e.g., received, reviewed, shortlisted, rejected).
*   **Detailed Analysis Table:**  Displays a table with detailed information for each candidate, including their name, email, match score, similarity score, status, and top strengths. The status column uses conditional styling to display different statuses (received, reviewed, shortlisted, analyzed, rejected) with appropriate background colors.

```javascript
// frontend/src/components/Dashboard/AnalysisResults.jsx
// Code Snippet: Analysis Results - Data Visualization

import React from 'react';
import { BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, Legend, ResponsiveContainer, PieChart, Pie, Cell } from 'recharts';

// ... (other imports and component setup)

  const scoreData = analysisResults.map(result => ({
    name: result.candidate_submissions?.candidate_name || 'Unknown',
    score: result.score || 0,
    similarity: result.similarity_score || 0,
  }));

  const statusDistribution = [
    { name: 'Received', value: analysisResults.filter(r => r.candidate_submissions?.status === 'received').length },
    { name: 'Reviewed', value: analysisResults.filter(r => r.candidate_submissions?.status === 'reviewed').length },
    { name: 'Shortlisted', value: analysisResults.filter(r => r.candidate_submissions?.status === 'shortlisted').length },
    { name: 'Rejected', value: analysisResults.filter(r => r.candidate_submissions?.status === 'rejected').length },
  ];

  const COLORS = ['#0088FE', '#00C49F', '#FFBB28', '#FF8042'];

  return (
    // ... (rest of the component)
            <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
              <BarChart
                data={scoreData}
                margin={{
                  top: 20,
                  right: 30,
                  left: 20,
                  bottom: 5,
                }}
              >
                <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
                <XAxis dataKey="name" />
                <YAxis />
                <Tooltip />
                <Legend />
                <Bar dataKey="score" name="Match Score" fill="#8884d8" />
                <Bar dataKey="similarity" name="Similarity Score" fill="#82ca9d" />
              </BarChart>
            </ResponsiveContainer>
    // ... (rest of the component)

export default function ApplicationList() {
  const { jobId } = useParams();
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  const updateApplicationStatus = useUpdateApplicationStatus();
  const { data: applications, isLoading, error, refetch } = useApplications(jobId);

  const handleStatusChange = async (applicationId, newStatus) => {
    try {
      await updateApplicationStatus.mutateAsync({ applicationId, status: newStatus });
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['applications', jobId] });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error updating status:', error);
      alert('Failed to update status');
    }
  };

    return (
        // ... (other imports and component setup)
        <select
          value={application.status}
          onChange={(e) => handleStatusChange(application.id, e.target.value)}

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    try {
      if (editingJob) {
        await updateJobPosting.mutateAsync({
          jobId: editingJob.id,
          updates: formData,
        });
        addToast('Job posting updated successfully!', 'success');
      } else {
        await createJobPosting.mutateAsync({
          ...formData,
          user_id: user?.id,
        });
        addToast('Job posting created successfully!', 'success');
      }
      
      setFormData({
        title: '',
        description: '',
        company: '',
        location: '',
        is_active: true,
      });
      setShowCreateForm(false);
      setEditingJob(null);
    } catch (error) {
      addToast(error.message || 'Failed to save job posting', 'error');

## Key Integration Points

The dashboard components are integrated to provide a seamless user experience for managing the recruitment process.  The `Dashboard` component acts as the main entry point and orchestrates the display of various sections:

1.  **Job Posting Management:** The `JobPostingManager` component allows users to create and manage job postings.
2.  **Application Review:** The `ApplicationList` component, accessible from job posting details in the dashboard, lists the applications for each job.
3.  **Analysis Results Display:**  The `AnalysisResults` component, similarly linked to individual job postings, presents the AI analysis of the candidate's resumes.  The scores and the detailed analysis are displayed within this component.

## Best Practices and Insights

*   **Data Fetching and State Management:** The application leverages React Query to efficiently fetch and manage data, reducing the need for manual state management and simplifying the code.
*   **Component Reusability:**  Reusable components, such as `Card` and `Button` from `frontend/src/components/common/`, are used to maintain a consistent UI and reduce code duplication.
*   **User Feedback:** The `useToast` context provides feedback messages to the user, enhancing the user experience.
*   **Modular Design:** The dashboard is built with a modular design, where different features are implemented as separate components.
*   **Error Handling:** The components include robust error handling to handle API failures and display meaningful error messages to the user.
*   **Performance:** Code splitting and lazy loading of components can further enhance the performance of the dashboard, especially as the application grows.

By combining these components, the AI Resume Screener dashboard provides a comprehensive platform to help recruiters streamline their hiring processes, from job posting creation to candidate evaluation. The integration of AI-powered analysis directly within the application review process is a key strength.
