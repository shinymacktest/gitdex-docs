## Getting Started

To set up the Track-Vault project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

-   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher.
-   **AWS S3 bucket**: Configured with appropriate credentials (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
-   **Supabase project**: For managing file metadata, user data, and analytics.
-   **EC2 instance (for deployment)**: Required if you plan to deploy the application to AWS.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Begin by cloning the Track-Vault repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/track-vault.git
    cd track-vault
    ```

    _Note: Replace `your-username` with the actual GitHub username or organization where the `track-vault` repository is hosted. For this example, we assume `sumedhcharjan` as per the implicit context of the prompt's GitHub links._

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Node.js dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command reads the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` listed in your `package.json` and installs them, creating a `node_modules` directory and updating `package-lock.json`.

## Project Structure Insights

Understanding the purpose of key configuration files is crucial for development and maintenance.

### `README.md`

The `README.md` file (View on GitHub) serves as the primary introduction to the Track-Vault project. It provides a high-level overview, lists core features, details the technical stack, and outlines initial setup instructions. This file is often the first point of contact for new contributors or users to understand the project's scope and how to get started.

### `package.json`

The `package.json` file (View on GitHub) is the heart of any Node.js/Next.js project. It contains metadata about the project, defines scripts for various development and build tasks, and lists all project dependencies and development dependencies.

-   **`name`**: `track-vault` - The name of the project.
-   **`version`**: `0.1.0` - The current version of the project.
-   **`private`**: `true` - Indicates that the package is not intended to be published to a public npm registry.
-   **`scripts`**:
    -   `dev`: `next dev` - Starts the development server.
    -   `build`: `next build` - Creates an optimized production build.
    -   `start`: `next start` - Starts the Next.js production server.
    -   `lint`: `next lint` - Runs ESLint for code quality checks.
-   **`dependencies`**: Lists packages required for the application to run in production. For example, `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for AWS S3 interactions, `@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs` for authentication, and `@supabase/supabase-js` for database and other Supabase services.
-   **`devDependencies`**: Lists packages only required for development and build processes, such as `@eslint/eslintrc` for linting and `tailwindcss` for styling.

```json
// package.json (excerpt)
{
  "name": "track-vault",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.873.0",
    "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs": "^2.8.6",
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@eslint/eslintrc": "^3",
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
    // ... other devDependencies
  }
}
```

### `package-lock.json`

The `package-lock.json` file (View on GitHub) is automatically generated by npm and records the exact version of every dependency, including nested dependencies, that was installed. This ensures that anyone installing the project's dependencies gets the exact same dependency tree, leading to reproducible builds across different environments. It guarantees consistency by locking down the entire dependency graph.

```json
// package-lock.json (excerpt)
{
  "name": "track-vault",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 3,
  "requires": true,
  "packages": {
    "": {
      "name": "track-vault",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "@aws-sdk/client-s3": "^3.873.0",
        "@kinde-oss/kinde-auth-nextjs": "^2.8.6",
        // ... more direct dependencies
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@eslint/eslintrc": "^3",
        "eslint": "^9",
        // ... more dev dependencies
      }
    },
    "node_modules/@aws-sdk/client-s3": {
      "version": "3.873.0",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/@aws-sdk/client-s3/-/client-s3-3.873.0.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-b+1lSEf+obcC508blw5qEDR1dyTiHViZXbf8G6nFospyqLJS0Vu2py+e+LG2VDVdAouZ8+RvW+uAi73KgsWl0w==",
      // ... its dependencies
    },
    // ... extensive list of all nested dependencies and their exact versions
  }
}
```

### `jsconfig.json`

The `jsconfig.json` file (View on GitHub) is used to define a JavaScript project, similar to how `tsconfig.json` defines a TypeScript project. It specifies compiler options, especially useful for configuring path aliases in Next.js applications, which helps with cleaner import paths.

```json
// jsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this configuration, `@/*` maps to `./src/*`, meaning that any import starting with `@/` will resolve to a path inside the `src` directory. For example, `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';` would resolve to `./src/components/ui/button.tsx`. This improves readability and maintainability by avoiding long relative paths like `../../../components/ui/button`.

## Key Integration Points

### User Authentication Flow

The Track-Vault platform integrates Kinde and Supabase Auth for a secure and streamlined user authentication experience. This ensures that only authorized users can access their private files and analytics dashboard.





```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor U as "User"
    participant A as "Application (Next.js)"
    participant K as "Kinde / Supabase Auth"
    participant D as "Supabase Database"

    U->>A: "Requests login/signup"
    A->>K: "Initiates authentication"
    K-->>U: "Authentication UI/Redirect"
    U->>K: "Enters credentials"
    K-->>A: "Authentication successful, provides token"
    A->>D: "Stores user metadata (if new)"
    A-->>U: "Redirects to dashboard / Grants access"
```



### File Upload and Access Workflow

Files in Track-Vault are securely stored in AWS S3 and accessed via signed URLs, ensuring privacy and controlled access. This process involves multiple components working together:





```mermaid

    A["User Uploads File"] --> B["Next.js Backend API"]
    B -->|"Generate Signed URL"| C["AWS S3"]
    C -->|"Upload via Signed URL"| B
    B -->|"Store Metadata in Supabase"| D["Supabase Database"]

```
