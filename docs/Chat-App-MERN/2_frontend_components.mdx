# Frontend Components: Detailed Structure

<TOC />

This section delves deeper into the structure and implementation of the frontend components, focusing on their interactions and data flow.

## Component Hierarchy (Inferred)

While the provided code doesn't explicitly show all components, we can infer a partial component hierarchy based on the existing code and common MERN application structures.

````mermaid
graph TD
    A[App] --> B(SettingsPage);
    A --> C(SignUpPage);
    C --> D[AuthImagePattern];
    style A fill:#ccf,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px
```

`AuthImagePattern` is a presentational component that provides a visual element to the signup page.  The `App` component (not provided) serves as the root component, managing routing and other global state.  The relationships shown highlight the way pages are composed in the application.


## State Management

The application utilizes Zustand for state management.  This is evident in `useAuthStore.js` which manages authentication state, and (inferred) `useThemeStore.js` for theme selection. Zustand's simplicity makes it suitable for managing the application's state effectively.

```javascript
//Snippet from useAuthStore.js demonstrating Zustand usage.
export const useAuthStore = create((set, get) => ({
    authUser: null,
    isSigningUp: false,
    // ... other state variables and functions ...
}));
```
