# Project Overview

This repository hosts the backend for a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) chat application. The project aims to provide a robust foundation for real-time messaging, user authentication, and profile management.

The application leverages the power of the MERN stack to deliver a scalable and interactive user experience. While this chunk primarily focuses on the backend implementation, it forms the core of the server-side logic and API endpoints.

## Credits

This project acknowledges inspiration from the following tutorial:

## MERN Stack Architecture

The MERN stack represents a powerful combination of technologies for building full-stack web applications:

*   **MongoDB**: A NoSQL, document-oriented database used for storing application data.
*   **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js, forming the backend API layer.
*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, handling the frontend presentation.
*   **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing JavaScript to run server-side.

### High-Level System Flow

```

The frontend (built with React) interacts with the Express.js backend via RESTful API calls. The Express backend then communicates with the MongoDB database for data persistence. Real-time features, common in chat applications, are typically handled using technologies like Socket.IO, which would also connect the backend directly to the frontend.
